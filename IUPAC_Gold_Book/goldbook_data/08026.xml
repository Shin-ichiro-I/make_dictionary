      <text>Mass (volume, amount of substance) of a specified component isolated from a system divided by the mass (volume, amount of substance) of the system prior to isolation.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>The measurement unit of material recovery is the measurement unit of the quantity related to the specified component divided by the unit of the quantity describing the system. When these units are the same, material recovery may be expressed as a percentage, and the quantity specified.</item>
        <item>The term "recovery" is also used to describe a recovered quantity value ratio. Therefore, the term "recovery" should not be used without qualification unless the meaning is clear from the context.</item>
