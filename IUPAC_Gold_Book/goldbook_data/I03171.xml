      <text>A solid or liquid, inorganic or organic substance containing exchangeable ions with others of the same charge, present in a solution in which the ion exchanger is considered to be insoluble. It is recognized that there are cases where liquid exchangers are employed and where it may be difficult to distinguish between the separation process as belonging to ion exchange or liquid-liquid distribution, but the broad definition given here is regarded as that which is most appropriate. A monofunctional ion exchanger contains only one type of ionogenic group, a bifunctional ion exchanger two types and a polyfunctional ion exchanger more than one type. In a macroporous ion exchanger the pores are large compared to atomic dimensions.</text>
