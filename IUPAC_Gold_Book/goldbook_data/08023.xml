      <text>Ability of a measuring system to provide measured quantity values that are directly proportional to the quantity value of the measurand.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>The linearity of a measuring system is assessed during procedure validation.</item>
        <item>The set of measured quantity values for which linearity of a measuring system applies is usually termed "linear interval" or "linear range".</item>
        <item>Linearity of a measuring system should not be confused with linearity of calibration.</item>
