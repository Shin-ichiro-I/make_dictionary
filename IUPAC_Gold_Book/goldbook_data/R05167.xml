      <text>A technique in which the identities of the sample components are intentionally changed between sample introduction and detection. The reaction can take place upstream of the column when the chemical identity of the individual components passing through the column differs from that of the original sample, or between the column and the detector when the original sample components are separated in the column but their identity is changed prior to entering the detection device.</text>
