      <text>A predetermined procedure for the selection, withdrawal, preservation, transportation and preparation of the portions to be removed from a population as samples. Summarizing the test values or observations from the selected portions yields an estimate for the concentration of an analyte or a value for a property determined with a calculable degree of uncertainty at a specified confidence level. A sampling plan includes the designation of the number, location and size of the portions, and instructions for the extent of compositing and for the reduction (in amount and fineness) of the portions to a laboratory sample and to test portions. It may also contain acceptance criteria. Some sampling plans do not include more than instructions for the statistical selection of portions to be removed. Such plans should properly be designated as 'statistical sampling plans'.</text>
