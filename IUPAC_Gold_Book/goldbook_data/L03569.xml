      <text>A scan, in an instrument comprising two or more analysers, in which two or more of the analyser fields are scanned simultaneously so as to preserve a pre-determined relationship between parameters characterizing these fields. Often, these parameters are the field strengths, but they may also be the frequencies in the case of analysers in which alternating fields are employed.</text>
