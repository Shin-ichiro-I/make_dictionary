      <text>A description of a property of a system by means of a set of specified rules, that maps the property onto a scale of specified values, by direct or 'mathematical' comparison with specified reference(s). The demand for rules makes 'measurement' a scientific concept in contrast to the mere colloquial sense of 'description'. However, in the present definition, 'measurement' has a wider meaning than given in elementary physics. Even a very incomplete description of, for instance, a patient (at a stated time) has to be given by a set of measurements, that are easier to manage and grasp.</text>
