      <text>In order to determine elements which are easily volatilized, or are present as volatile species, organic material may be ashed in oxygen in a closed oxygen combustion system. One such method is oxygen-flask combustion by which the test sample is burned in a closed flask containing oxygen and an absorbing solution in which the analytes are subsequently determined.</text>
