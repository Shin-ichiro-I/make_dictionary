      <text>The time-dependent change of those properties of a precipitate, e.g. loss of water, growth of crystals, recrystallization, decrease of the specific surface, loss of coprecipitated substances, which generally improve the filtering properties. The process of ageing is very often promoted by maintaining the precipitate and precipitation medium together at elevated temperatures for a period of time. The terms chemical, physical and thermal ageing may be used in cases in which some of the (usually combined) effects named above are to be emphasized specifically.</text>
