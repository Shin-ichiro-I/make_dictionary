      <text>The effect of spectral background due to impurities, solvent or radiation scattering may be reduced if the difference in the absorbances of a sample measured at two selected wavelengths is obtained. This is often achieved by repetitively switching from one wavelength to the other. Double-wavelengthspectroscopy does this automatically by allowing two beams of radiation of different wavelengths to pass through the cell. One beam is fixed at a longer wavelength and the other measures absorbance while being scanned over a limited wavelength range at shorter wavelengths.</text>
