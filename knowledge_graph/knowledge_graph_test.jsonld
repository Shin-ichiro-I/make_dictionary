      "The quantity of light available to molecules at a particular point in the atmosphere and which, on absorption, drives photochemical processes in the atmosphere. It is calculated by integrating the spectral radianceL(λ,θ,ϕ) over all directions of incidence of the light, S(λ) = ∫θ.∫φ.{L(λ,θ,φ)/(hc/λ)}.sinθ.dθ.dφ. If the radiance is expressed in J m-2 s-1 st-1 nm-1 and h.c/λ is the energy per quantum of light of wavelengthλ, the actinic flux has units of quanta cm-2 s-1 nm-1. This important quantity is one of the terms required in the calculation of j-values, the first order rate coefficients for photochemical processes in the sunlight-absorbing, trace gases in the atmosphere. The actinic flux is determined by the solar radiation entering the atmosphere and by any changes in this due to atmospheric gases and particles (e.g. Rayleigh scattering absorption by stratospheric ozone, scattering and absorption by aerosols and clouds), and reflections from the ground. It is therefore dependent on the wavelength of the light, on the altitude and on specific local environmental conditions. The actinic flux has borne many names (e.g. flux, flux density, beam irradiance, actinic irradiance, integrated intensity) which has caused some confusion. It is important to distinguish the actinic flux from the spectral irradiance, which refers to energy arrival on a flat surface having fixed spatial orientation (J m-2 nm-1) given by: . The actinic flux does not refer to any specific orientation because molecules are oriented randomly in the atmosphere. This distinction is of practical relevance: the actinic flux (and therefore a j-value) near a brightly reflecting surface (e.g. over snow or above a thick cloud) can be a factor of three higher than that near a non-reflecting surface. The more descriptive name of spectral spheradiance is suggested for the quantity herein called actinic flux."

In reaction dynamics, the word has been used in a microscopic sense, with a range of meanings which have only a tenuous relationship to the thermodynamic meaning or the etymology. Whereas the thermodynamic meaning relates to conditions imposed on a process by an observer, the microscopic meaning relates to conditions under which the process occurs naturally. The microscopic meanings, as used in reaction dynamics, all have in common the feature that quantum states remain unchanged during the course of reaction. Different quantum states may be referred to: A reaction that is not adiabatic is referred to as nonadiabatic or diabatic, and some workers make a distinction between the two words."

The term is most commonly applied to conjugated nucleophiles, for example the enolate ion: [image: Not defined] (which may react with electrophiles either at the β-carbon atom or at oxygen) or γ-pyridones, and also to the vicinally ambident cyanide ion, cyanate ion, thiocyanate ion, sulfinate ion, nitrite ion and unsymmetrical hydrazines. Ambident electrophiles are exemplified by carboxylic estersRC(=O)OCR3 which react with nucleophiles either at the carbonyl carbon or the alkoxy carbon. Molecular entities, such as dianions of dicarboxylic acids, containing two non-interacting (or feebly interacting) reactive centres, are not generally considered to be ambident and are better described as 'bifunctional'. The Latin root of the word implies two reactive centres, but the term has in the past also incorrectly been applied to chemical species with more than two reactive centres. For such species the existing term 'polydent' (or, better, 'multident') is more appropriate."

      "When a part of a molecule ('molecular fragment') undergoes two changes in bonding (bond-making or bond-breaking), either to a common centre or to two related centres, external to itself, these bonding changes may be related in one of two spatially different ways. These are designated as 'antarafacial' if opposite faces of the molecular fragment are involved, and 'suprafacial' if both changes occur at the same face. The concept of 'face' is clear from the diagrams in the cases of planar (or approximately planar) frameworks with isolated or interacting p-orbitals [diagrams (a) and (b)]. [image: Not defined] The terms antarafacial and suprafacial are, however, also employed in cases in which the essential part of the molecular fragment undergoing changes in bonding comprises two atoms linked only by a σ-bond. In these cases it is customary to refer to the phases of the local σ-bonding orbital: occurrence of the two bonding changes at sites of like orbital phase is regarded as suprafacial, whereas that at two sites of opposite phase is antarafacial. The possibilities are shown for C–C and C–H σ-bonds in diagrams (c) and (d). There may be two distinct and alternative stereochemical outcomes of a suprafacial process involving a σ-bond between saturated carbon atoms, i.e. either retention or inversion at both centres. The antarafacial process results in inversion at one centre and retention at the second. For examples of the use of these terms, see cycloaddition, sigmatropic rearrangement."

A quantitative assessment of the degree of aromaticity is given by the value of the resonance energy. It may also be evaluated by the energies of relevant isodesmic and homodesmotic reactions. Along with energetic criteria of aromaticity, important and complementary are also a structural criterion (the lesser the alternation of bond lengths in the rings, the greater is the aromaticity of the molecule) and a magnetic criterion (existence of the diamagnetic ring current induced in a conjugated cyclic molecule by an external magnetic field and manifested by an exaltation and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility). Although originally introduced for characterization of peculiar properties of cyclic conjugated hydrocarbons and their ions, the concept of aromaticity has been extended to their homoderivatives (see homoaromaticity), conjugated heterocyclic compounds (heteroaromaticity), saturated cyclic compounds (σ-aromaticity) as well as to three-dimensional organic and organometallic compounds (three-dimensional aromaticity). A common feature of the electronic structure inherent in all aromatic molecules is the close nature of their valence electron shells, i.e., double electron occupation of all bonding MOs with all antibonding and delocalized nonbonding MOs unfilled.

If the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate A are freely interconvertible and if an equal amount or excess of a non-racemizing second enantiomerically pure chemical species, say (R)-B, is added to a solution of racemic A, then the resulting equilibrium mixture of adducts A · B will, in general, contain unequal amounts of the diastereoisomers (R)-A · (R)-B and (S)-A · (R)-B. The result of this equilibration is called asymmetrictransformation of the first kind. If, in such a system, the two diastereoisomeric adducts differ considerably in solubility so that only one of them, say (R)-A · (R)-B, crystallizes from the solution, then the equilibration of diastereoisomers in solution and concurrent crystallization will continue so that all (or most) of the substrate A can be isolated as the crystalline diastereoisomer (R)-A · (R)-B.

If the two radical centres are located on the same atom, the species are more properly referred to by their generic names: carbenes, nitrenes, etc. The lowest-energy triplet state of a biradical lies below or at most only a little above its lowest singlet state (usually judged relative to kB.T, the product of the Boltzmann constantkB and the absolute temperature T). The states of those biradicals whose radical centres interact particularly weakly are most easily understood in terms of a pair of local doublets. Theoretical descriptions of low-energy states of biradicals display the presence of two unsaturated valences (biradicals contain one fewer bond than permitted by the rules of valence): the dominant valence bond structures have two dots, the low energy molecular orbitalconfigurations have only two electrons in two approximately nonbonding molecular orbitals, two of the natural orbitals have occupancies close to one, etc. Although this term has been recommended in the past for diradicals, specialists working in the field prefer the latter term."

KHA is the acid dissociation constant of the acid HA, p is the number of equivalent acidic protons in the acid HA, and q is the number of equivalent basic sites in its conjugate base A−. The chosen values of p and q should always be specified. (The charge designations of H and A are only illustrative.) The Brønsted relation is often termed the 'Brønsted catalysis law' (or the 'Catalysis Law'). Although justifiable on historical grounds, this name is not recommended, since Brønsted relations are known to apply to many uncatalysed and pseudo-catalysed reactions (such as simple protondron ). The term 'pseudo-Brønsted relation' is sometimes used for reactions which involve nucleophilic catalysis instead of acid–base catalysis.

For example, in gas-phase electron-diffraction experiments, the bond length is the interatomic distance averaged over all occupied vibrational states at a given temperature. In an X-ray crystal structural method, the bond length is associated with the distance between the centroids of electron densities around the nuclei. In gas-phase microwave spectroscopy, the bond length is an effective interatomic distance derived from measurements on a number of isotopic molecules, etc. A number of empirical relationships between bond lengths and bond orders in polyatomic molecules were suggested, see, for example, fractional bond number (the Pauling's bond order)."

Different schemes of partitioning electron density give rise to different definitions of bond orders. In the framework of the Mulliken population analysis, bond order is associated with the total overlap population, q AB = 2 ∑ µ A ∑ ν B P µν S µν and S µν are respectively the elements of the density matrix and overlap matrix (see overlap integral). A large positive value of bond order signifies strong bonding between the atoms of the molecular entity, whereas negative values of q AB imply that electrons are displaced away from the inter-atomic region and point to an anti-bonding interaction. In valence bond theory, bond order is given by a weighted average of the formal bond orders (i.e. by the number of electron pairs in a given Lewis structure) between the atoms in the resonance structures (see resonance hybrid)."

The same term is applied to similar conformations of analogous saturated six-membered ring structures containing hetero-atoms and/or bearing substituent groups, but these conformations may be distorted from the exact D3d symmetry. For cyclohexane and most such analogues, the chair form is the most stableconformation. If the cyclohexane conformation has no centre of symmetry but possesses two planes of symmetry, one of them bisecting the bonds between atoms 1 and 2 and between 4 and 5 and the other plane passing through atoms 3 and 6 (which lie out of the plane and on the same side of the plane containing 1, 2, 4 and 5), that conformation (of symmetry group C2v ) is called a boat form and it is generally not a stable form. Again, this term is also applied to structural analogues. The conformation of D2 symmetry passed through in the interconversion of two boat forms of cyclohexane is called the twist form (also known as skewboat, skew form and stretched form). [image: Not defined] In a five-membered ring a conformation in which two adjacent atoms are maximally displaced, in opposite directions, relative to the plane containing the other three carbon atoms has been called a half-chair but is better called a twist conformation.

Emission of photons in the X-ray wavelength region also occurs from ionized gases or plasmas at high temperatures, from nuclear processes (low-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum) and from radiative transitions between muonic states. Characteristic X-ray emission consists of a series of X-ray spectral lines with discrete frequencies, characteristic of the emitting atom. Other features are emission bands from transitions to valence levels. In a spectrum obtained with electron or photon excitation the most intense lines are called diagram lines or normal X-ray lines. They are dipole allowed transitions between normal X-ray diagram levels."

The phrase 'separate binding sites' is intended to exclude cases such as [PtCl3(CH2=CH2)]−, ferrocene and (benzene)tricarbonylchromium in which ethene, the cyclopentadienyl group and benzene, respectively, are considered to present single binding sites to the respective metal atom, and which are not normally thought of as chelates."

In many cases, and in particular when the displacement from equilibrium is slight, the progress of the system towards equilibrium can be expressed as a first-order law: Ct - (Ceq)2 = [(Ceq)1 - (Ceq)2]e(-t/τ) and Ceq2 are the equilibrium concentrations of one of the chemical species involved in the reaction before and after the change in the external parameter, and Ct is its concentration at time t. The time parameter τ, named relaxation time, is related to the rate constants of the chemical reaction involved.

The letters shown in parentheses (upper case C, G, A, T) are the recommended abbreviations. The symbols G+, G- (or A+, G-, for example) refer to torsion angles of similar type but opposite known sign, i.e. ~ +60°, ~ -60° (or ~ +120°, -120° ). The notation G, G(bar) ; A, A(bar) (and T, T(bar) ; C, C(bar) - whenever the torsion angles are not exactly equal to 180° and 0°, respectively) is reserved for the designation of enantiomorph conformations, i.e. conformations of op- posite but unspecified sign. Where necessary, a deviation from the proper value of the torsion angle can be indicated by the sign (~), as in the following examples: G(~); G^+ (~); G^- (~)."

A measurement is made of the intensity of light transmitted through the dust spot formed relative to that transmitted through an identical clean filter. The dirtiness of the air is reported in terms of the COH unit. This relates to the quantity of particulate material which produces an optical density, log 10 ( I 0 I ) and relative to the transmission of an identical dust-free filter taken as 100%. Thus a filter which transmitted 50% relative to the clean filter has an absorbance of 0.301 or 30.1 COH units.

      "The distance over which order is maintained. As an example, there can be long-range atomic or molecular order, i.e. coherence. Coherence lengths are significantly larger than molecular size. Normally, coherence length is estimated from electron, neutron or X-ray scattering and scales the size of ordered domains in material where long range ordering occurs (as in liquid crystals, for example). The term coherence length is also used for the scale characterizing the profile of molecular axis orientation in the distorted, so-called, transition layers formed at a solid/liquid-crystal boundary when an appropriate external field is applied (e.g. when the orientation of anchored surface molecules of a nematic liquid crystal is unaffected by an external field -- magnetic or electric -- whereas the bulk molecules reorient freely). This scale is referred to as electric coherence length, ζ E or magnetic coherence length, ζ M, depending on the nature of the applied field."

      "Various collision theories, dealing with the frequency of collision between reactant molecules, have been put forward. In the earliest theories reactant molecules were regarded as hard spheres, and a collision was considered to occur when the distance d between the centres of two molecules was equal to the sum of their radii. For a gas containing only one type of molecule, A, the collision density is given by simple collision theory as: Z AA = 2 π σ 2 u N A 2 2 is the number density of molecules and u is the mean molecular speed, given by kinetic theory to be 8kB.Tπm, where m is the molecular mass, and σ = π d AA 2. Thus: Z AA = 2 N A 2 σ 2 π k B T m for two unlike molecules A and B, of masses m A and m B is: Z AB = N A N B σ 2 π k B T µ is the reduced massm A m B m A + m B, and σ = π d AB 2. For the collision frequency factor these formulations lead to the following expression: z AA or z AB = L σ 2 8 π k B T µ is the Avogadro constant. More advanced collision theories, not involving the assumption that molecules behave as hard spheres, are known as generalized kinetic theories."

Usually CN are counted as the active nuclei at about 300% relative humidity, while cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are counted as the number of active nuclei at relative humidity less than or equal to 102%."

The mechanism of many condensation reactions has been shown to comprise consecutive addition and elimination reactions, as in the base-catalysed formation of (E)-but-2-enal (crotonaldehyde) from acetaldehyde, via 3-hydroxybutanal (aldol). The overall reaction in this example is known as the aldol condensation. The term is sometimes also applied to cases where the formation of water or another simple molecule does not occur, as in 'benzoin condensation'."

The contributing structures, also called 'canonical forms', themselves thus have a purely formal significance: they are the components from which wavefunctions can be built. Structures may be covalent (or non-polar) or ionic (or polar).

The primary current distribution is that which establishes itself when the influence of overpotential is negligible. The secondary current distribution is that which establishes itself when the influence of the overpotential cannot be neglected but concentration overpotential is negligible. The secondary distribution is often described in terms of dimensionless numbers of the form where Wa = (κ/l).(dη/dj) is the conductivity of the solution, dη/dj the slope of the overpotential-current curve under the above conditions and l a characteristic length of the system, for instance the radius of a disc electrode. Wa is the Wagner number. It is a quantity which determines the throwing power and characterizes the equalizing influence of overpotential on the current distribution. In electroplating the throwing power is qualitatively defined as 'the ability of a solution to deposit metal uniformly upon a cathode of irregular shape'. The tertiary current distribution is that which establishes itself when the influence of the overpotential (including concentration overpotential) cannot be neglected."

It is given by the stoichiometry of the reaction and by the amount of substance of B reacting (per unit time and per unit electrode area) in the reaction considered. The current efficiency of reaction k, ɛk is defined as the ratio of jk to the total c.d.: ɛk = jk/∑m.jm may be larger than one if cathodic and anodic reactions take place simultaneously at the same electrode. However, ɛk still gives correctly the product yield, which is the quantity of industrial interest. The product yield is the amount of substance of B produced per unit charge and is equal to ɛk.νB,k/nk.F (in the absence of a chemical reaction which is consecutive to the electrode reaction and which consumes or produces species B). n k is the charge number of electrode reactionk. Note that in the case of simultaneous electrode reactions the distribution of the partial c.d. jk may be different from that of the total c.d., i.e. the function (jk)x/j = fk(x) may be different from jx/j = f(x).

      "A reaction in which two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity. The following two systems of notations have been used for the more detailed specification of cycloadditions, of which the second, more recent system [described under (2)] is preferred:   A(i + j + ...) cycloaddition is a reaction in which two or more molecules (or parts of the same molecule), respectively, provide units of i, j, ... linearly connected atoms: these units become joined at their respective termini by new σ-bonds so as to form a cycle containing (i + j + ...) atoms. In this notation, (a) a Diels–Alder reaction is a (4+2) cycloaddition, (b) the initial reaction of ozone with an alkene is a (3+2) cycloaddition, and (c) the reaction shown below is a (2+2+2) cycloaddition. (N.B.: parentheses (...) are used in the description based on numbers of atoms.) [image: Not defined]  The symbolism [i + j + ...] for a cycloaddition identifies the numbers i, j, ... of electrons in the interacting units that participate in the transformation of reactants to products. In this notation the reaction (a) and (b) of the preceding paragraph would both be described as [2+4] cycloadditions, and (c) as a [2+2+2] cycloaddition. The symbol a or s (a = antarafacial, s = suprafacial) is often added (usually as a subscript after the number to designate the stereochemistry of addition to each fragment. A subscript specifying the orbitals, viz. σ, π (sigma, pi) with their usual significance) or n (for an orbital associated with a single atom only), may be added as a subscript before the number. Thus the normal Diels–Alder reaction is a [4s + 2s] or [π4s + π2s] cycloaddition, whilst the reaction: [image: Not defined] would be a [14a + 2s] or [π14a + π2s] cycloaddition. (N.B. Square brackets [...] are used in the descriptions based on numbers of electrons.) Cycloadditions may be pericyclic reactions or (non-concerted stepwise reactions . The term 'dipolar cycloaddition' is used for cycloadditions of 1,3-dipolar compounds."

The effects are particularly evident in aromatic systems and in symmetrical molecular entities in which a lone pair of electrons or a vacant p-orbital is conjugated with a double bond (e.g. carboxylate ions, nitro compounds, enamines, the allyl cation). Delocalization in such species may be represented by partial bonds or as resonance (here symbolized by a two-headed arrow) between contributing structures.

This is now commonly taken to include both through-bonds and through-space transmission, but I is also used specifically for through-bonds transmission; through-space transmission is then symbolized as F (for field effect). The symbols for the influence of substituents exerted through electron delocalization have variously been M (mesomeric), E (electromeric), T (tautomeric), C (conjugative), K (konjugativ) and R (resonance). Since the present fashion is to use the term resonance effect, R is the most commonly used symbol, although M is still seen quite often. Both the possible sign conventions are in use. The Ingold sign convention associates electronegativity (relative to hydrogen atom) with a negative sign, electropositivity with a positive sign. Thus the nitro group is described as electronwithdrawing by virtue of its -I and -M effects; chloro is described as a -I, +M substituent, etc. For correlation analysis and linear free-energy relationships this convention has been found inconvenient, for it is in contradiction to the sign convention for polar substituent constants (σ-constants). Authors concerned with these fields often avoid this contradiction by adopting the opposite sign convention originally associated with Robinson, for electronic effects. This practice is almost always associated with the use of R for the electron delocalization effect: thus the nitro group is a +I, +R substituent; chloro a +I, -R substituent, etc."

The most notable example of electron-transfer catalysis is the S RN 1 (or T + D N + A N) reaction of aromatic halides. The term has its origin in a suggested analogy to acid-base catalysis, with the electron instead of the proton. However, there is a difference between the two catalytic mechanisms, since the electron is not a true catalyst, but rather behaves as the initiator of a chain reaction. 'Electron-transfer induced chain reaction' is a more appropriate term for the situation described by equations (1)–(3)."

In this equation kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, h the Planck constant, and R the gas constant. The enthalpy of activation is approximately equal to the activation energy; the conversion of one into the other depends on the molecularity.

There is growing evidence that some of the ions formed are due to thermal ionization and some to field ionization of vapour evaporated from material on the emitter. Because there is generally little or no ionization unless the emitter is heated by an electric current, 'field desorption' is a misnomer. The term is, however, firmly implanted in the literature and most users undertand what is going on regardless of the implications of the term. In addition, no better simple term has been suggested to take its place and so, reluctantly, it is recommended that it be retained."

The symbol m * should be used to indicate the apparent mass of the product ions giving rise to this peak. Traditionally, the peak itself has been called a metastable peak and this should preferably be expressed as metastable ion peak. It is nevertheless recommended that the former term should be retained. The word metastable should never be used as a noun. Its use as an adjective should be limited to such terms as metastable ion, where it is used correctly, and to the special case of metastable peak discussed above. It should never be used in such terms as metastable reaction, metastabledecomposition, metastable studies, etc. It should be clear that the metastable ion is the ion that undergoes fragmentation; it is not detected.

      "In an electrode reaction, when reactants or intermediates are adsorbed, the rate of reaction may no longer be related to the concentration by a simple law. The deviation may be due to either entropic or energetic effects or both. The situation best understood is that where a reactant is non-specifically adsorbed in the outer Helmholtz plane (inner boundary of the diffuse layer). The effect of such adsorption on electrode kinetics is usually termed the Frumkin effect. Rate constants, transfer coefficients etc. corrected for this effect are frequently called 'true' rate constants etc. It would be preferable to describe them as 'corrected for the Frumkin effect', but in any case, if such a correction is carried out, the basis on which it is made should be clearly described."

The gain of this process is defined as the number of electrons collected on the anode wire for each primary electron produced. For X-rays having energies higher than the excitation potential of the detector gas, the spectral responsivity function has a second peak in addition to the main peak that is called the escape peak. The escape peak has a mean pulse height proportional to the difference between the photon energy of the incident X-rays and of the spectral characteristic line of the detector gas. A quenching gas, a molecular gas, is added to the detector gas in order to neutralize the detector gas ions and to absorb secondary electrons as well as UV radiation resulting from neutralization of detector gas ions. According to the potential applied to the anode, the detector can work as an ionization chamber, proportional counter, or Geiger counter."

This change is then sensed by the ion-selective electrode and is related to the partial pressure of the gaseous species in the sample. [Note: In electrochemical literature the term gas electrode is used for the classical, redox-equilibrium-based gas electrodes as well, such as the hydrogen or the chlorine gas electrodes (Pt (s)|H2 (g) | H+ (aq) or Pt (s) |Cl2 (g) | Cl− (aq)]. These electrodes respond both to the partial pressure of the gas (H2 or Cl2 ) and to the ionic activities (H+ or Cl−). The Clark oxygen electrode fits under this classification although, in contrast to other gas sensors, it is an amperometric and not a potentiometric device."

These points are often connected by a smooth curve (a 'Gibbs energy profile', commonly still referred to as a 'free energy profile') but experimental observation can provide information on relative standard Gibbs energies only at the maxima and minima and not at the configurations between them. The abscissa expresses the sequence of reactants, products, reaction intermediates and transition states and is usually undefined or only vaguely defined by the reaction coordinate (extent of bond breaking or bond making). In some adaptations the abscissas are however explicitly defined as bond orders, Brønsted exponents, etc. Contrary to statements in many text books, the highest point on a Gibbs energy diagram does not necessarily correspond to the transition state of the rate-limiting step. For example, in a stepwise reaction consisting of two reaction steps: [image: Not defined] one of the transition states of the two reaction steps must (in general) have a higher standard Gibbs energy than the other, whatever the concentration of D in the system. However, the value of that concentration will determine which of the reaction steps is rate-limiting. If the particular concentrations of interest, which may vary, are chosen as the standard state, then the rate-limiting step is the one of highest Gibbs energy. [image: Not defined]"

      "The hypothesis that, when a transition state leading to an unstablereaction intermediate (or product) has nearly the same energy as that intermediate, the two are interconverted with only a small reorganization of molecular structure. Essentially the same idea is sometimes referred to as 'Leffler's assumption', namely, that the transition state bears the greater resemblance to the less stable species (reactant or reaction intermediate/product). Many text books and physical organic chemists, however, express the idea in Leffler's form, but attribute it to Hammond. As a corollary, it follows that a factor stabilizing a reaction intermediate will also stabilize the transition state leading to that intermediate. The acronym 'Bemahapothle' (Bell, Marcus, Hammond, Polanyi, Thornton, Leffler) is sometimes used in recognition of the principal contributors towards expansion of the original idea of the Hammond postulate."

The monosaccharide is depicted with the carbon-chain horizontal and in the plane of the paper, the potential carbonyl group being to the right. The oxygen bridge is then depicted as being formed behind the plane of the paper. The heterocyclic ring is therefore located in a plane approximately perpendicular to the plane of the paper and the groups attached to the carbon atoms of that ring are above and below the ring. The carbon atoms of the ring are not shown. Groups that appear to the right of the vertical chain in the Fischer projection (structures A, D) then appear below the plane of the ring in the Haworth representation (structures B, C, E). However, at the asymmetric carbon atom (C-5 in A; C-4 in D) involved via oxygen in ring formation with the carbon atom of the carbonyl group a formal double inversion must be envisaged to obtain the correct Haworth representation. In the pyranose forms of d-aldohexoses C-6 will always be above the plane, In the furanose forms of d-aldohexoses the position of C-6 will depend on the configuration at C-4; it will, for example, be above the plane in d-glucofuranoses (e.g. C) but below the plane in d-galactofuranoses (e.g. E).

To achieve all this matching, one should significantly extend the number and types of reference molecules. In the aliphatic series of hydrocarbons these are propane, isobutane and neopentanes as well as propene and isobutene; for aromatics—buta-1,3-diene, 2-vinylbutadiene (3-methylidenehexa-1,5-diene) and 2,3-divinylbutadiene (3,4-bismethylidenehexa-1,5-diene). Thus to assess strain energy of cyclopropane and aromatic stabilization of benzene the following homodesmotic reactions are to be respectively analysed..c-(CH2)3 + 3 CH3–CH3ΔHexp0 = -26.5 kcal/mol (110.9 kJ/mol).C6H6 + 3 CH2=CH2Δ H calc 0 (MP2/6-31G**) = 23.9  (100.0 kJ/mol). Due to closer matching of the hybridization states of the atoms of reactants and products as compared to isodesmic reactions, the homodesmotic reactions give more accurate estimates of the intrinsic strain and the cyclic delocalization. The definition may be extended to molecules with heteroatoms."

A theoretical distinction may be made between the field effect, and the inductive effect as models for the Coulomb interaction between a given site within a molecular entity and a remote unipole or dipole within the same entity. The experimental distinction between the two effects has proved difficult, except for molecules of peculiar geometry, which may exhibit 'reversed field effects'. Ordinarily the inductive effect and the field effect are influenced in the same direction by structural changes in the molecule and the distinction between them is not clear. This situation has led many authors to include the field effect in the term 'inductive effect'. Thus the separation of values into inductive and resonance components does not imply the exclusive operation of a through-bonds route for the transmission of the non-conjugative part of the substituent effect. To indicate the all-inclusive use of the term inductive, the phrase 'so-called inductive effect' is sometimes used. Certain modern theoretical approaches suggest that the 'so-called inductive effect' reflects a field effect rather than through-bonds transmission."

Examples of such approximated complex profiles are: the electrical double-layer consisting of a surface charge layer (i.e. a two dimensional distribution of one type of ions) and a diffuse charge layer (counter-ions distributed over the space region next to the surface); the approximated profile of the orientation angle of anisotropic liquid molecules within a 'double-layer' consisting of a distribution of so-called anchored molecules which are perturbed (strongly bound and orientated) by the surface, and the adjacent, so-called, transition layer, i.e. the region where the surface perturbation is damped."

Complex profiles of interfacial properties occur in the case of multicomponent systems with coexisting bulk phases where attractive/repulsive molecular interactions involve adsorption or depletion of one or several components.

      "Any substance, other than the ion being measured, whose presence in the sample solution affects the measured emf of a cell. Interfering substances fall into two classes: 'electrode/electrochemical' interferences and 'chemical' interferences. Examples of the first class include:  Those substances which give a similar response to the ion being measured and whose presence generally results in an apparent increase in the activity (or concentration) of the ion to be determined (e.g. Na+ for the Ca2+ electrode).   Electrolytes present at a high concentration that give rise to appreciable liquid junction potential differences or results in a significant activity coefficient decrease, or incipient Donnan exclusion failure. The second class of substances that should be recognized as chemical interferences includes:   Species that interact with the ion being measured so as to decrease its activity or apparent concentration. The electrode continues to report the true activity (e.g. CN− present in the measurement of Ag+), but a considerable gap will occur between the activity and concentration of the ions even in very dilute solutions. Under these circumstances the determination of ionic concentration may be problematic.   Substances interacting with the membrane itself, blocking the surface or changing its chemical composition [i.e. organic solvents for the liquid or poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane electrodes] are grouped as interferences or electrode poisons."

A tight ion pair of X+ and Y− is symbolically represented as X+Y−. By contrast, an ion pair whose constituent ions are separated by one or several solvent or other neutral molecules is described as a 'loose ion pair', symbolically represented as X+ || Y−. The members of a loose ion pair can readily interchange with other free or loosely paired ions in the solution. This interchange may be detectable (e.g. by isotopic labelling) and thus afford an experimental distinction between tight and loose ion pairs. A further conceptual distinction has sometimes been made between two types of loose ion pairs. In 'solvent-shared ion pairs' the ionic constituents of the pair are separated by only a single solvent molecule, whereas in 'solvent-separated ion pairs' more than one solvent molecule intervenes. However, the term 'solvent-separated ion pair' must be used and interpreted with care since it has also widely been used as a less specific term for 'loose' ion pair."

      "An electrochemical sensor, based on thin films or selective membranes as recognition elements, and an electrochemical half-cell equivalent to other half-cells of the zeroth (inert metal in a redox electrolyte), 1st, 2nd and 3rd kinds. These devices are distinct from systems that involve redox reactions (electrodes of zeroth, 1st, 2nd and 3rd kinds), although they often contain a 2nd kind electrode as the 'inner' or 'internal' reference electrode. The potential difference response has, as its principal component, the Gibbs energy change associated with permselective mass transfer (by ion-exchange, solvent extraction or some other mechanism) across a phase boundary. The ion-selective electrode must be used in conjunction with a reference electrode (i.e. 'outer' or 'external' reference electrode) to form a complete electrochemical cell. The measured potential differences (ion-selective electrode vs. outer reference electrode potentials) are linearly dependent on the logarithm of the activity of a given ion in solution. Comment: The term 'ion-specific electrode' is not recommended. The term 'specific' implies that the electrode does not respond to additional ions. Since no electrode is truly specific for one ion, the term 'ion-selective' is recommended as more appropriate. 'Selective ion-sensitive electrode' is a little-used term to describe an ion-selective electrode. 'Principal' or 'primary' ions are those which an electrode is designed to measure. It is never certain that the 'principal' ion is most sensitively measured, e.g. nitrate ion-selective electrodes."

Comment: When an isothermal cell is used with identical reference electrodes, the isopotential point is the activity of sensed species that gives zero net membrane potential, e.g. sensed activity is the same in the inner and outer (test) solution. Calibration lines for different cell temperatures have different slopes, but intersect at a common activity point. Cells with temperature gradients are not recommended."

      "The general effect of an added electrolyte (i.e. an effect other than, or in addition to, that due to its possible involvement as a reactant or catalyst) on the observed rate constant of a reaction in solution. At low concentrations (when only long-range coulombic forces need to be considered) the effect on a given reaction is determined only by the ionic strength of the solution and not by the chemical identity of the ions. For practical purposes, this concentration range is roughly the same as the region of validity of the Debye–Hückel limiting law for activity coefficients. At higher concentrations, the effect of an added electrolyte depends also on the chemical identity of the ions. Such specific action can usually be interpreted as the incursion of a reaction path involving an ion of the electrolyte as reactant or catalyst, in which case the action is not properly to be regarded just as a kinetic electrolyte effect. Kinetic electrolyte effects are usually (too restrictively and therefore incorrectly) referred to as 'kinetic salt effects'. A kinetic electrolyte effect ascribable solely to the influence of the ionic strength on activity coefficients of ionic reactants and transition states is called a 'primary kinetic electrolyte effect'. A kinetic electrolyte effect arising from the influence of the ionic strength of the solution upon the pre-equilibrium concentration of an ionic species that is involved in a subsequent rate-limiting step of a reaction is called a 'secondary kinetic electrolyte effect'. A common case encountered in practice is the effect on the concentration of hydrogen ion (acting as catalyst) produced from the ionization of a weak acid in a buffer solution.

For example, in the reaction: [image: Not defined] the effect of isotopic substitution in reactant A is expressed as the ratio of rate constants kl/kh, where the superscripts l and h represent reactions in which the molecules A contain the light and heavy isotopes, respectively. Within the framework of transition state theory in which the reaction is rewritten as: [image: Not defined] and with neglect of isotopic mass on tunnelling and the transmission coefficient, kl/kh can be regarded as if it were the equilibrium constant for an isotope exchange reaction between the transition state[TS]‡ and the isotopically substituted reactant A, and calculated from their vibrational frequencies as in the case of a thermodynamic isotope effect. Isotope effects like the above, involving a direct or indirect comparison of the rates of reaction of isotopologues, are called 'intermolecular', in contrast to intramolecular isotope effects, in which a single substrate reacts to produce a non-statistical distribution of isotopomeric product molecules."

For signals originating in a greater depth of the sample (back scattered electrons, X-rays) the lateral resolution is worse than the corresponding value of the beam diameter due to the diffusion of the primary electrons. The lateral resolution may be determined exactly with a sandwich specimen or a sharp edge specimen, or approximately with a specimen showing a regular microstructure of known dimensions. Recommended abbreviation: Lat. Res. (qualitative); unit: m; range: nm or µm. For quantitative analysis, this should be defined as the minimum distance of two points (areas) on the specimen corresponding to signal ratios of 10E4. This condition assures that the value for the lateral resolution defines the diameter of the analytical area which yields the total analytical signal. Due to the effect of electron diffusion in a solid and 'tail effects' in ion beam analysis the quantitative lateral resolution is significantly larger than the beam diameter.

If it is assumed that each measurement y i of y has associated with it a number w i-1 characteristic of the uncertainty, then numerical estimates of the a0, a1, ..., aK are found by constructing a variableS, defined by S = ∑ i ( w i ( y i- f i ) ) 2 except aj.

If the relations between the a and y are non-linear, there is an increase in the difficulty of finding a solution, but the problem is essentially unchanged."

      "In biochemistry: if it is possible or convenient to regard part of a polyatomic molecular entity as central, then the atoms, groups or molecules bound to that part are called ligands. Biochemical usage is thus wider, in that the central entity can be polyatomic. Thus H+ may be a ligand for proteins and for citrate as well as for O2−. It may even be a ligand for a univalent entity such as acetate: in other circumstances, AcO− may be the ligand for H+, since the definition makes it clear that the view of which entity is central may change for convenience. Thus, four calcium ions are ligands for calmodulin, when the protein is regarded as central: four carboxylate groups of calmodulin ligate (are ligands of) each calcium ion when this ion is regarded as central. It is the ligand that is said to ligate the central entity, which is said to be ligated. When the hormone binding to a receptor is called a ligand, the receptor is thus regarded as the central entity. Biochemists should bear in mind that the usage in inorganic chemistry has been that ligands bind only single atoms, so they should be cautious in fields such as bioinorganic chemistry where confusion may be possible.

The temperature at which the two ferromagnetic subarrays of a ferrimagnet just cancel each other is called the compensation point. Materials exhibit ferromagnetic behaviour when unpaired electron spins are aligned in parallel, antiferromagnetic behaviour when the alignment is antiparallel, and ferrimagnetic behaviour if the alignment of the spins is antiparallel with unequal numbers in the two orientations or if the spins are canted. Therefore, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and weak ferromagnetic transitions involve a net magnetic moment change, whereas antiferromagnetic transitions have zero net magnetic moment change."

'In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.' This is an indirect statement of the common mechanistic observation, that the more electropositive (electrophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the end of the multiple bond that would result in the more stablecarbenium ion (whether or not a carbenium ion is actually formed as a reaction intermediate in the addition reaction). Addition in the opposite sense is commonly called 'anti-Markovnikov addition'."

      "The outcome of an analytical measurement (application of the chemical measurement process), or value attributed to a measurand. This may be the result of direct observation, but more commonly it is given as a statistical estimate derived from a set of observations. The distribution of such estimates (estimator distribution) characterizes the chemical measurement process, in contrast to a particular estimate, which constitutes an experimental result. Additional characteristics become evident if we represent x ̂ as follows: x(hat) = τ + e = τ + Δ + δ = µ + δ, is the value x that would result if the chemical measurement process were error-free. The error, e, is the difference between an observed (estimated) value and the true value; i.e. e = x(hat) - τ (signed quantity). The total error generally has two components, bias (Δ) and random error(δ), as indicated above. The limiting mean, µ, is the asymptotic value or population mean of the distribution that characterizes the measured quantity; the value that is approached as the number of observations approaches infinity. Modern statistical terminology labels this quantity the expectation value or expected value, E(x(carat)). The bias, Δ, is the difference between the limiting mean and the true value; i.e. Δ = µ- τ (signed quantity). The random error, δ, is the difference between an observed value and the limiting mean; i.e. δ = x ̂- µ (signed quantity)."

Inferences concerning the electronic motions which dynamically interconvert successive species along the reaction path (as represented by curved arrows, for example) are often included in the description of a mechanism. It should be noted that for many reactions all this information is not available and the suggested mechanism is based on incomplete experimental data. It is not appropriate to use the term mechanism to describe a statement of the probable sequence in a set of stepwise reactions.

The membrane of an ion-selective electrode is responsible for the EMF response and selectivity of the entire electrode. Comment: Membranes of sensor electrodes are thought to be practically homogeneous, but an actual membrane may contain inhomogeneous regions, often at surfaces, and connected with materials and preparation methods used. Inhomogeneous regions include low dielectric polymer regions with few charge sites and regions with high local site densities. Surface regions of plasticized liquid membranes often are low in sites and high in plasticizer or exuded impurities."

The definition is experimental, i.e. it applies to any reaction that follows an equation of this general form. The symbols V max or v max are sometimes used for V. The parameters V and Km (the 'Michaelis constant') of the equation can be evaluated from the slope and intercept of a linear plot of v-1vs. [S]-1 (a 'Lineweaver–Burk plot') or from slope and intercept of a linear plot of vvs. v/[S] ('Eadie–Hofstee plot'). A Michaelis–Menten equation is also applicable to the condition where E is present in large excess, E appears in the equation instead of S. The term has sometimes been used to describe reactions that proceed according to the scheme: in which case Km = (k-1 + kcat)/k1 (Briggs–Haldane conditions). It has more usually been applied only to the special case in which k-1 ≫ k cat and Km = k-1/k1 = Ks; in this case Km is a true dissociation constant (Michaelis–Menten conditions)."

      "The term is traditionally applied to any reaction that involves a change of connectivity (sometimes including hydrogen), and violates the so-called 'principle of minimum structural change'. According to this oversimplified principle, chemical species do not isomerize in the course of a transformation, e.g. substitution, or the change of a functional group of a chemical species into a different functional group is not expected to involve the making or breaking of more than the minimum number of bonds required to effect that transformation. For example, any new substituents are expected to enter the precise positions previously occupied by displaced groups. The simplest type of rearrangement is an intramolecular reaction in which the product is isomeric with the reactant (one type of 'intramolecularisomerization'). An example is the first step of the Claisen rearrangement: [image: Not defined] The definition of molecular rearrangement includes changes in which there is a migration of an atom or bond (unexpected on the basis of the principle of minimum structural change), as in the reaction: [image: Not defined] where the rearrangement stage can formally be represented as the '1,2-shift' of hydride between adjacent carbon atoms in the carbocation: [image: Not defined] Such migrations occur also in radicals, e.g.: [image: Not defined] The definition also includes reactions in which an entering group takes up a different position from the leaving group, with accompanying bond migration. An example of the latter type is the 'allylic rearrangement': [image: Not defined] A distinction is made between 'intramolecular rearrangements' (or 'true molecular rearrangements') and 'intermolecular rearrangements' (or 'apparent rearrangements'). In the former case the atoms and groups that are common to a reactant and a product never separate into independent fragments during the rearrangement stage (i.e. the change is intramolecular), whereas in an 'intermolecularrearrangement' a migrating group is completely free from the parent molecule and is re-attached to a different position in a subsequent step, as in the Orton reaction: [image: Not defined]"

'Synartetic acceleration' is the special case of anchimeric assistance ascribed to participation by electrons binding a substituent to a carbon atom in a β-position relative to the leaving group attached to the α-carbon atom. According to the underlying model, these electrons then provide a three-centre bond (or 'bridge') 'fastening together' (as the word 'synartetic' is intended to suggest) the α- and β-carbon atoms between which the charge is divided in the intermediate bridged ion formed (and in the transition state preceding its formation).

In a polyatomic molecule the NAOs (in contrast to natural orbitals that become delocalised over all nuclear centres) mostly retain one-centre character, and thus are optimal for describing the molecular electron density around each atomic centre."

The NOs reduce the density matrix ρ to a diagonal form: ρ = ∑ k b k Φ k * Φ k where the coefficients bk are occupation numbers of each orbital. The importance of natural orbitals is in the fact that CI expansions based on these orbitals have generally the fastest convergence. If a CI calculation was carried out in terms of an arbitrary basis set and the subsequent diagonalisation of the density matrix ai j gave the natural orbitals, the same calculation repeated in terms of the natural orbitals thus obtained would lead to the wave-function for which only those configurations built up from natural orbitals with large occupation numbers were important."

      "The behaviour of an atomic or localized molecular orbital under molecular symmetry operations characterizes its orbital symmetry. For example, under a reflection in an appropriate symmetry plane, the phase of the orbital may be unchanged (symmetric), or it may change sign (antisymmetric), i.e. the positive and negative lobes are interchanged. A principal context for the use of orbital symmetry is the discussion of chemical changes that involve 'conservation of orbital symmetry'. If a certain symmetry element (e.g. the reflection plane) is retained along a reaction pathway, that pathway is 'allowed' by orbital symmetry conservation if each of the occupied orbitals of the reactant(s) is of the same symmetry type as a similarly (e.g. singly or doubly) occupied orbital of the product(s). This principle permits the qualitative construction of correlation diagrams to show how molecular orbitals transform (and how their energies change) during idealized chemical changes (e.g. cycloadditions). An idealized single bond is a σ-bond, i.e. it has cylindrical symmetry, whereas a p-orbital or π-bond orbital has π-symmetry, i.e. it is antisymmetric with respect to reflection in a plane passing through the atomic centres with which it is associated. In ethene, the π-bonding orbital is symmetric with respect to reflection in a plane perpendicular to and bisecting the C–C bond, whereas the π*-antibonding orbital is antisymmetric with respect to this operation. Considerations of orbital symmetry are frequently grossly simplified in that, for example, the p-orbitals of a carbonyl group would be treated as having the same symmetry as those of ethene, and the fact that the carbonyl group in, for example, camphor, unlike that in formaldehyde, has no mirror planes would be ignored. These simplified considerations nevertheless afford the basis of one approach to the understanding of the rules which indicate whether pericyclic reactions are likely to occur under thermal or photochemical conditions."

    "definitions": [
      "If the macroscopic (observed, empirical or phenomenological) rate of reaction (v) for any reaction can be expressed by an empirical differential rate equation (or rate law) which contains a factor of the form k[A]^α.[B]^β ... (expressing in full the dependence of the rate of reaction on the concentrations A, B ...) where α, β are constant exponents (independent of concentration and time) and k is independent of A and B etc. (rate constant, rate coefficient), then the reaction is said to be of order α with respect to A, of order β with respect to B, ... , and of (total or overall) order n = α + β + ... The exponents α, β, ... can be positive or negative integral or rational nonintegral numbers. They are the reaction orders with respect to A, B, ... and are sometimes called 'partial orders of reaction'. Orders of reaction deduced from the dependence of initial rates of reaction on concentration are called 'orders of reaction with respect to concentration'; orders of reaction deduced from the dependence of the rate of reaction on time of reaction are called 'orders of reaction with respect to time'. The concept of order of reaction is also applicable to chemical rate processes occurring in systems for which concentration changes (and hence the rate of reaction) are not themselves measurable, provided it is possible to measure a chemical flux. For example, if there is a dynamic equilibrium according to the equation: aA ⇌ p P with respect to A ... and of total (or overall) order n ( = α + λ + ... ). The proportionality factor k above is called the (nth order) 'rate coefficient'. Rate coefficients referring to (or believed to refer to) elementary reactions are called 'rate constants' or, more appropriately 'microscopic' (hypothetical, mechanistic) rate constants. The (overall) order of a reaction cannot be deduced from measurements of a 'rate of appearance' or 'rate of disappearance' at a single value of the concentration of a species whose concentration is constant (or effectively constant) during the course of the reaction. If the overall rate of reaction is, for example, given by: v = k A α B β, and the rate of disappearance of A can be expressed in the form: v A = k obs A α deduced from such an experiment is called the 'observed rate coefficient' and it is related to the (α + β)th order rate coefficientk by the equation: kobs = k[B]^β, kobs is often referred to as a 'pseudo-first order rate coefficient' (kψ). For a simple (elementary) reactions a partial order of reaction is the same as the stoichiometric number of the reactant concerned and must therefore be a positive integer (see rate of reaction ). The overall order is then the same as the molecularity . For stepwise reactions there is no general connection between stoichiometric numbers and partial orders. Such reactions may have more complex rate laws, so that an apparent order of reaction may vary with the concentrations of the chemical species involved and with the progress of the reaction: in such cases it is not useful to speak of orders of reaction, although apparent orders of reaction may be deducible from initial rates. In a stepwise reaction, orders of reaction may in principle always be assigned to the elementary steps."

It is attained before an interval during which this current decreases monotonically with time because the rate of transport of B toward the electrode-solution interface is smaller than the rate at which it is removed from the interface by electrolysis. The term has also been used to denote the maximum value of the faradaic current attributable to the reduction or oxidation of an electroactive substance in techniques such as ac polarography, differential pulse polarography, and derivative polarography.

Peak width at half height (w h) is the length of the line parallel to the peak base at 50% of the peak height that terminates at the intersection with the two limbs of the peak. Peak width at inflection points (w i) is the length of the line drawn between the inflection points parallel to the peak base. The peak width at base may be called the 'base width'. However, the peak width at half height must never be called the 'half width' because that has a completely different meaning. Also, the symbol w 1 / 2 should never be used instead of w h."

      "A two-electrode, radiation-sensitive junction formed in a semiconductive material. A junction is formed by two successive regions of a semiconductive material having, respectively, an excess of electrons (n-type) or holes (p-type). A bias potential applied to the detector creates a region at the interface that is depleted of majority carriers. Each incident photon produces electron-hole pairs in the depletion region resulting in a measurable signal current. The photodiode can be operated either with zero bias in the photovoltaic mode where the photodiode is actually generating the electric potential supplied to the load. In a biased mode, the photoconductive mode, the reverse current is proportional to the irradiation. A Schottky-barrier photodiode is constructed by deposition of a metal film on a semiconductor surface in such a way that no interface layer is present. The barrier thickness depends on the impurity dopant concentration in the semiconductor layer. The incident radiation generates electon-hole pairs within the depletion region of the barrier where they are collected efficiently and rapidly by the built-in field. A PIN (p-intrinsic-n) diode is a planar diffused diode consisting of a single crystal having an intrinsic (undoped or compensated) region sandwiched between p- and n-type regions. A bias potential applied across the detector depletes the intrinsic region of charge carriers, constituting the radiation-sensitive detector volume. The number of electron-hole pairs produced is dependent on the energy of the incident photons. An avalanche photodiode is a photodiode in which the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are accelerated by a bias potential near to breakdown potential so that further electron-hole pairs are formed leading to saturation of the photocurrent. This operational mode for photon counting is the so-called Geiger mode, similar to that of the gas filled Geiger counter. Avalanche photodiodes can also be operated in the proportional mode."

It consists of a photocathode, a series of dynodes, called a dynode chain on which a secondary-electron multiplication process occurs, and an anode. According to the desired response time, transit time, time spread, gain, or low dark current, different types of dynode structures have been developed, e.g. circular cage structure, linear focused structure, venetian blind structure, box and grid structure. Some special dynode structures permit combination with additional electric or magnetic fields. A strip dynode photomultiplier tube consists of a photocathode followed by thin dynode material on an insulating substrate. In a continuous-strip photomultiplier, two strip dynodes are arranged in parallel. A potential applied to the ends of the two strips produces an electric field across the continuous strip dynodes, giving rise to electron multiplication along the dynodes. In a resistance-strip magnetic photomultiplier, a uniform magnetic field is applied to the planes of the strips, so that the electrons travel in the crossed electric and magnetic fields. A channel photomultiplier tube photocathode consists of a channel electron multiplier (CEM) system for the photoelectrons, and an anode to collect the final electron current. The basic part of the CEM is a tube with a semiconducting inner surface. In general it is curved in order to inhibit the acceleration of positive ions towards the photocathode. A number of small channels called microchannels can be constructed in arrays for imaging applications."

For simple systems two such coordinates (characterizing two variables that change during the progress from reactants to products) can be selected, and the potential energy plotted as a contour map. For simple elementary reactions, e.g. A–B + C → A + B–C , the surface can show the potential energy for all values of the A, B, C geometry, providing that the ABC angle is fixed. For more complicated reactions a different choice of two coordinates is sometimes preferred, e.g. the bond orders of two different bonds. Such a diagram is often arranged so that reactants are located at the bottom left corner and products at the top right. If the trace of the representative point characterizing the route from reactants to products follows two adjacent edges of the diagram, the changes represented by the two coordinates take place in distinct succession; if the trace leaves the edges and crosses the interior of the diagram, the two changes are concerted. In many qualitative applications it is convenient (although not strictly equivalent) for the third coordinate to represent the standard Gibbs energy rather than potential energy. Using bond orders is, however, an oversimplification, since these are not well-defined, even for the transition state. (Some reservations concerning the diagrammatic use of Gibbs energies are noted under Gibbs energy diagram). The energetically easiest route from reactants to products on the potential-energy contour map defines the potential-energy profile."

The acid or base is then not a catalyst and the phenomenon cannot be called catalysis according to the well-established meaning of these terms in chemical kinetics, although the mechanism of such a process is often intimately related to that of a catalysed reaction. It is recommended that the term pseudo-catalysis be used in these and analogous cases (not necessarily involving acids or bases). For example, if a Brønsted acid accelerates the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, this is properly called acid catalysis, whereas the acceleration, by the same acid, of hydrolysis of an amide should be described as pseudo-catalysis by the acid: the 'acid pseudo-catalyst' is consumed during the reaction through formation of an ammonium ion. The terms 'general acid pseudo-catalysis' and 'general base pseudo-catalysis' may be used as the analogues of general acid catalysis and general base catalysis. The term 'base-promoted', 'base-accelerated' or 'base-induced' is sometimes used for reactions that are pseudo-catalysed by bases.

The methods of perturbation theory are based on representation of the Hamiltonian of a system under study, H, through the Hamiltonian, H0, of a system, whose Schroedinger equation is solvable, and its relatively small perturbation H': H = H0 + H'. Numerous techniques are derived allowing one to relate the unknown eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the perturbed system to the known eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the unperturbed system. As distinct from the variational method, the methods of perturbation theory are applicable to all the electronic states of an atom or molecule. When H' is time-dependent, the perturbed system does not have stationary states. In this case time-dependent perturbation theory, which is the method of approximate calculation of the expansion of wave-functions of the perturbed system over wave-functions of stationary states of the unperturbed system, must be employed. The applications of this method are associated mostly with studies of light emission and absorption by atoms and molecules."

A detector yielding an output signal that is independent of the wavelength of the radiation over a specific region is called a nonselective detector. Where it is wavelength specific it is a selective detector. A detector having a quantum efficiency independent of the wavelength is a nonselective quantum counter. Certain detectors are able to distinguish between different quantum energies. This property is described by the energy resolution Δ E and the energy resolving powerE Δ E. These detectors are called energy dispersive detectors. In X-ray spectroscopy, the reciprocal Δ E E is often used but this is discouraged."

Paramagnetic metal ions are not normally regarded as radicals. However, in the 'isolobal analogy' the similarity between certain paramagnetic metal ions and radicals becomes apparent. At least in the context of physical organic chemistry, it seems desirable to cease using the adjective 'free' in the general name of this type of chemical species and molecular entity, so that the term 'free radical' may in future be restricted to those radicals which do not form parts of radical pairs. Depending upon the core atom that possesses the unpaired electron, the radicals can be described as carbon-, oxygen-, nitrogen-, metal-centred radicals. If the unpaired electron occupies an orbital having considerable s or more or less pure p character, the respective radicals are termed σ- or π-radicals. In the past, the term 'radical' was used to designate a substituent group bound to a molecular entity, as opposed to 'free radical', which nowadays is simply called radical. The bound entities may be called groups or substituents, but should no longer be called radicals."

      "A rate-controlling (rate-determining or rate-limiting) step in a reaction occurring by a composite reactionsequence is an elementary reaction the rate constant for which exerts a strong effect — stronger than that of any other rate constant — on the overall rate. It is recommended that the expressions rate-controlling, rate-determining and rate-limiting be regarded as synonymous, but some special meanings sometimes given to the last two expressions are considered under a separate heading. A rate-controlling step can be formally defined on the basis of a control function (or control factor) CF, identified for an elementary reaction having a rate constantki by: CF = ∂(lnv)/∂lnki is the overall rate of reaction. In performing the partial differentiation all equilibrium constants Kj and all rate constants except ki are held constant. The elementary reaction having the largest control factor exerts the strongest influence on the rate v, and a step having a CF much larger than any other step may be said to be rate-controlling. A rate-controlling step defined in the way recommended here has the advantage that it is directly related to the interpretation of kinetic isotope effects. As formulated this implies that all rate constants are of the same dimensionality. Consider however the reaction of A and B to give an intermediate C, which then reacts further with D to give products:    [image: Not defined]  (1)    [image: Not defined]  (2)   Assuming that C reaches a steady state, then the observed rate is given by: v = k 1 k 2 A B D k-1 + k 2 D a pseudo-first order rate constant, then k2[D] ≫ k-1, and the observed rate v = k 1 A B and kobs = k1. Step (1) is said to be the rate-controlling step. If k2[D] ≪ k-1, then the observed rate: v = k 1 k 2 k-1 A B D = K k 2 A is the equilibrium constant for the pre-equilibrium (1) and is equal to k1/k-1, and kobs = K.k2. Step (2) is said to be the rate-controlling step."

However, other meanings that have been given to them should be mentioned, as it is necessary to be aware of them in order to avoid confusion. Sometimes the term rate-determining is used as a special case of rate-controlling, being assigned only to an initial slow step which is followed by rapid steps. Such a step imposes an upper limit on the rate, and has also been called rate-limiting. In view of the considerable danger of confusion when special meanings are applied to rate-determining and rate-limiting, it is recommended that they be regarded as synonymous, with the meaning explained under the entry rate-controlling step."

It is recommended that the unit of time should always be the second. In such a case the rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its coefficient in the stoichiometric equation, p) and from the rate of decrease of concentration of the reactant A by α-1. The quantity: ξ . = d ξ d t designates the amount of substance A, conventionally expressed in units of mole) may be called the 'rate of conversion' and is appropriate when the use of concentrations is inconvenient, e.g. under conditions of varying volume. In a system of constant volume, the rate of reaction is equal to the rate of conversion per unit volume throughout the reaction. For a stepwise reaction this definition of 'rate of reaction' (and 'extent of reaction', ξ) will apply only if there is no accumulation of intermediate or formation of side products. It is therefore recommended that the term 'rate of reaction' be used only in cases where it is experimentally established that these conditions apply. More generally, it is recommended that, instead, the terms 'rate of disappearance' or 'rate of consumption' of A (i.e. -d[A]/dt, the rate of decrease of concentration of A) or 'rate of appearance' of P (i.e. d[P]/dt, the rate of increase of concentration of product P) be used, depending on the concentration change of the particular chemicalspecies that is actually observed. In some cases reference to the chemicalflux observed may be more appropriate. The symbol v (without lettered subscript) should be used only for rate of reaction; v with a lettered subscript (e.g. v A) refers to a rate of appearance or rate of disappearance (e.g. of the chemical species A)."

In the formalism of 'transition-state theory', the reaction coordinate is that coordinate in a set of curvilinear coordinates obtained from the conventional ones for the reactants which, for each reaction step, leads smoothly from the configuration of the reactants through that of the transition state to the configuration of the products. The reaction coordinate is typically chosen to follow the path along the gradient (path of shallowest ascent/deepest descent) of potential energy from reactants to products. The term has also been used interchangeably with the term transition coordinate, applicable to the coordinate in the immediate vicinity of the potential energy maximum. Being more specific, the name transition coordinate is to be preferred in that context."

The ratio of the detector output and the detector input is defined as the responsivity. It is given in e.g. ampere/watt, volt/watt. The responsivity is a special case of the general term sensitivity. Dark current is the term for the electrical output of a detector in the absence of input. This is a special case of the general term dark output. For photoconductive detectors the term dark resistance is used. If the responsivity is normalized with regard to that obtained from a reference radiation the resulting ratio is called relative responsivity. For measurements with monochromatic radiation at a given wavelength the term spectral responsivityR λ is used. In some cases the relative spectral responsivity, where the spectral responsivity is normalized with respect to the responsivity at some given wavelength, is used. The dependence of the spectral responsivity on the wavelength is described by the spectral responsivity function. The useful spectral range of the detector should be given as the wavelength range where the relative responsivity does not fall below a specified value."

      "A measure of the time the sample component resides in the stationary phase relative to the time it resides in the mobile phase; it expresses how much longer a sample component is retarded by the stationary phase than it would take to travel through the column with the velocity of the mobile phase. Mathematically, it is the ratio of the adjusted retention volume (time) and the hold-up volume (time): k = VR'/VM = tR'/tM, then the fraction in the stationary phase is 1- R; thus k = 1 - R/R is often used for the retention factor, particularly in liquid chromatography. The original reason for this was to clearly distinguish it from the partition coefficient (distribution constant) for which the symbol K had been utilized. Since, however, the distribution constants are all identified with a subscript, there is no reason to add the prime sign to this symbol. It should be emphasized that all the recognized nomenclatures (IUPAC, BS, ASTM) have always clearly identified the capacity factor with the symbol k and not k'. The logarithm of the retention factor is equivalent to the R M value used in planar chromatography. The symbol κ is suggested to express"

      "Retention measurements (and measurements of hold-up volume and peak width) may be made in terms of times or chart distances as well as volumes. If flow and recorder speeds are constant, the volumes are directly proportional to the times and chart distances. The following definitions are drawn up in terms of volume, and it is recommended that theoretical discussion should be couched in the same terms wherever possible. The total retention volume, V R, is the volume of eluentcarrier gas admitted to the column between the injection of the sample and the emergence of the peak maximum of the specified component. It includes the hold-up volume. In gas chromatography, the volume of carrier gas is specified at the outlet pressure and temperature of the column. Note: the word 'total' in this definition allows retention time to be used as a general term when specification of a particular quantity is not required. The adjusted retention volume, V R ', is the total retention volume less the hold-up volume, V M, i.e. V R ' = V R- V M = V ̄- V I is the peak elution volume and V I the interstitial volume. The net retention volume, V N, is the adjusted retention volume multiplied by the pressure-gradient correction factor: V N = j V R ', is the net retention volume per gram of stationary liquid, active solid or solvent-free gel. In liquid chromatography, except when conducted at very high pressures, the compression of the mobile phase is negligible, and the adjusted and net retention volumes are identical. The specific retention volume is then the adjusted retention volume per gram of stationary liquid, active solid, or solvent-free gel. It is recommended that, when appropriate, authors specify the drying conditions. At 0°C, V g = 273 V N w L T is the mass of the stationary liquid phase."

A surprising feature of the equation is the absence of a coefficient of N +, characteristic of the substrate (cf. the s in the Swain–Scott equation), even though values of N + vary over 13 log units. The equation thus involves a gigantic breakdown of the reactivity–selectivity principle. The equation has been extended both in form and in range of application."

      "The terms are symmetry designations, π molecular orbitals being antisymmetric with respect to a defining plane containing at least one atom (e.g. the molecular plane of ethene) and σ molecular orbitals symmetric with respect to the same plane. In practice the terms are used both in this rigorous sense (for orbitals encompassing the entire molecule) and also for localized two-centre orbitals or bonds, and it is necessary to make a clear distinction between the two usages. In the case of two-centre bonds, a π-bond has a nodal plane that includes the internuclear bond axis, whereas a σ-bond has no such nodal plane. (A δ-bond in organometallic or inorganic molecular species has two nodes.) Radicals are classified by analogy into σ- and π-radicals. Such two-centre orbitals may take part in molecular orbitals of σ- or π-symmetry. For example, the methyl group in propene contains three C–H bonds, each of which is of local σ-symmetry (i.e. without a nodal plane including the internuclear axis), but these three 'σ-bonds' can in turn be combined to form a set of group orbitals one of which has π-symmetry with respect to the principal molecular plane and can accordingly interact with the two-centre orbital of π-symmetry (π-bond) of the double-bonded carbon atoms, to form a molecular orbital of π-symmetry. Such an interaction between the CH3 group and the double bond is an example of what is called hyperconjugation. This cannot rigorously be described as 'σ–π conjugation' since σ and π here refer to different defining planes, and interaction between orbitals of different symmetries (with respect to the same defining plane) is forbidden."

Sampling error is determined by replication of the laboratory samples and their multiple analyses.

One speaks of α, β, (etc.) secondary isotope effects, where α, β, (etc.) denote the position of isotopic substitution relative to the reaction centre. The corresponding isotope effect on the equilibrium constant of such a reaction is called a 'secondary equilibrium isotope effect'. Secondary isotope effects have been discussed in terms of the conventional electronic effects of physical organic chemistry, e.g. induction, hyperconjugation, hybridization, etc., since these properties are determined by the electron distribution, that depends on vibrationally averaged bond lengths and angles which vary slightly with isotopic substitution. While this usage is legitimate, the term 'electronic isotope effect' should be avoided, because of the misleading implication that such an effect is electronic rather than vibrational in origin."

A second method of stating sensitivity, that is most suitable for gases, depends upon the change of ion current related to the change of partial pressure of the sample in the ion source. It is important that the relevant experimental conditions corresponding to sensitivity measurement should always be stated. These include in a typical case details of the instrument type, bombarding electron current, slit dimensions, angular collimation, gain of the multiplier detector, scan speed and whether the measured signal corresponds to a single mass peak or to the ion beam integrated over all masses. Some indication of the time involved in the determination should be given, e.g. counting time or band width. The sensitivity should be differentiated from the detection limit."

There is normally a concurrent relocation of π-bonds in the molecule concerned, but the total number of π- and σ- bonds does not change. The term was originally restricted to intramolecular pericyclic reactions, and many authors use it with this connotation. It is, however, also applied in a more general, purely structural, sense. If such reactions are intramolecular, their transition state may be visualized as an association of two fragments connected at their termini by two partial σ-bonds, one being broken and the other being formed as, for example, the two allyl fragments in (a'). Considering only atoms within the (real or hypothetical) cyclic array undergoing reorganization, if the numbers of these in the two fragments are designated i and j, then the rearrangement is said to be a sigmatropic change of order [i, j] (conventionally [i]≤[j]). Thus the rearrangement (a) is of order [3,3], whilst reaction (b) is a [1,5]sigmatropic shift of hydrogen. (N.B. By convention square brackets [...] here refer to numbers of atoms, in contrast with current usage in the context of cycloaddition.) [image: Not defined] [image: Not defined] The descriptors a and s (antarafacial and suprafacial) may also be annexed to the numbers i and j; (b) is then described as a [1s,5s] sigmatropic rearrangement, since it is suprafacial with respect both to the hydrogen atom and to the pentadienyl system: [image: Not defined] The prefix 'homo' (meaning one extra atom, interrupting conjugation — cf. 'homoaromaticity') has frequently been applied to sigmatropic rearrangements, but is misleading."

It is based on the creation of a time histogram of many stochastic events involving the time delay between the electronic excitation of a molecule or material and its emission of a photon from an excited state. A key to the technique is that no more than one photon strike the detector per pulsed excitation. Excitation is commonly achieved with a flash from a repetitive nanosecond lamp or diode laser or a CW operated laser (mode-locked laser). The essential components of the hardware are a device to measure the excitation-emission delay time and another to determine the relative frequency of photons reaching the detector at each delay time. Delay times are usually measured with a time-to-amplitude-converter (TAC), using voltage to measure the delay between a start and a stop signal. The frequency of events with each delay is stored in a multi-channel analyser. This term is preferred to time-correlated single-photon counting."

The key reaction is usually one of attachment; the diamagneticreagent is said to be a 'spin trap' and the persistent product radical is then the 'spin adduct'. The procedure is referred to as spin trapping, and is used for monitoring reactions involving the intermediacy of reactive radicals at concentrations too low for direct observation. Typical spin traps are C-nitroso compounds and nitrones, to which reactive radicals will rapidly add to form nitryl radicals. A quantitative development, in which essentially all reactive radicals generated in a particular system are intercepted, has been referred to as 'spin counting'. Spin trapping has also been adapted to the interception of radicals generated in both gaseous and solid phases. In these cases the spin adduct is in practice transferred to a liquid solution for observation in order to facilitate interpretation of the EPR/ESR spectra of the radicals obtained."

The expression chromatographic bed or sorbent may be used as a general term to denote any of the different forms in which the stationary phase is used. Particularly in gas chromatography where the stationary phase is most often a liquid, the term liquid phase is used for it as compared to the gas phase, i.e. the mobile phase. However, particularly in the early development of liquid chromatography, the term 'liquid phase' had also been used to characterize the mobile phase as compared to the 'solid phase' i.e. the stationary phase. Due to this ambiguity, the use of the term 'liquid phase' is discouraged. If the physical state of the stationary phase is to be expressed, the use of the adjective forms such as liquid stationary phase and solid stationary phase, bonded phase or immobilized phase is proposed."

      "In a kinetic analysis of a complex reaction involving unstable intermediates in low concentration, the rate of change of each such intermediate is set equal to zero, so that the rate equation can be expressed as a function of the concentrations of chemical species present in macroscopic amounts. For example, assume that X is an unstable intermediate in the reaction sequence: [image: Not defined] [image: Not defined] Conservation of mass requires that: [A] + [X] + [D] = [A]0 which, since [A]0 is constant, implies: -d[X]/dt = d[A]/dt + d[D]/dt. Since [X] is negligibly small, the rate of formation of D is essentially equal to the rate of disappearance of A, and the rate of change of [X] can be set equal to zero. Applying the steady state approximation (d[X]/dt = 0) allows the elimination of [X] from the kinetic equations, whereupon the rate of reaction is expressed: d[D]/dt = -d[A]/dt = k1.k2[A][C]/(k-1 + k2[C])",

The steric effect in a reaction is ascribed to the difference in steric energy between, on the one hand, reactants and, on the other hand, a transition state (or products). A steric effect on a rate process may result in a rate increase ('steric acceleration') or a decrease ('steric retardation'). (The adjective 'steric' is not to be confused with stereochemical.) Steric effects arise from contributions ascribed to strain as the sum of (1) non-bonded repulsions, (2) bond angle strain and (3) bond stretches or compressions. For the purpose of correlation analysis or linear free-energy relations various scales of steric parameters have been proposed, notably A values, Taft's E s and Charton's ν scales. In a reactant molecule RY and an appropriate reference molecule RoY, the 'primary steric effect' of R is the direct result of differences in compressions which occur because R differs from Ro in the vicinity of the reaction centre Y. A 'secondary steric effect' involves the differential moderation of electron delocalization by non-bonded compressions. Some authors make a distinction between 'steric' effects attributed to van der Waals repulsions alone, and 'strain' effects, attributed to deviations of bond angles from 'ideal' values."

      "This term applies broadly to variations of quantum yields of photophysicalprocesses (e.g. fluorescence or phosphorescence ) or photochemical reactions (usually reaction quantum yield) with the concentration of a given reagent which may be a substrate or a quencher. In the simplest case, a plot of Φ 0 Φ (or M 0 M for emission) vs. concentration of quencher, [Q], is linear obeying the equation: Φ 0 Φ or M 0 M = 1 + K sv Q is referred to as the Stern–Volmer constant. Equation (1) applies when a quencher inhibits either a photochemical reaction or a photophysical process by a single reaction. Φ 0 and M 0 are the quantum yield and emission intensity radiant exitance, respectively, in the absence of the quencher Q, while Φ and M are the same quantities in the presence of the different concentrations of Q. In the case of dynamic quenching the constant Ksv is the product of the true quenching constantkq and the excited statelifetime, τ 0, in the absence of quencher. kq is the bimolecular reaction rate constant for the elementary reaction of the excited state with the particular quencher Q. Equation (1) can therefore be replaced by the expression (2): Φ 0 Φ or M 0 M = 1 + k q τ 0 Q to form a product, a double-reciprocal relationship is observed according to the equation: 1/Φp = (1 + (1/kr.τ0.[S])).(1/A.B) is the quantum efficiency of product formation, A the efficiency of forming the reactive excited state, B the fraction of reactions of the excited state with substrate S which leads to product, and [S] is the concentration of reactive ground-state substrate. The intercept/slope ratio gives kr.τ0. If [S] = [Q], and if a photophysical process is monitored, plots of equations (2) and (3) should provide independent determinations of the product-forming rate constantkr. When the lifetime of an excited state is observed as a function of the concentration of S or Q, a linear relationship should be observed according to the equation: τ 0 τ = 1 + k q τ 0 [Q] is the lifetime of the excited state in the absence of the quencher Q."

The component added to the system may dissociate or react with other components to form a series of derived components and only a fraction of the original component may actually exist in a free form in the system. It is therefore essential to distinguish between the stoichiometric concentration and the amount-of-substance concentration of the free form of the component in the system. Sometimes stoichiometric quantities are indicated by a subscript (o), e.g. n o,B, co,B. In clinical chemistry, the term stoichiometric concentration is rarely employed. Instead, the name of the component is modified to indicate inclusion of the various derived forms, e.g. mixtures of a defined chemical component and its derivatives may be denoted by the plural form of the name of the pure unchanged substance, or to indicate the sum of components specified in individual quantities the specification 'total' may be employed."

In general, the contributions of these components are inseparable and interdependent. A quantitative assessment of strain and strain energies can be made by taking the difference between the heat of formation of the substance under consideration and that of a hypothetical strain-free model. Several approaches to the assessment of strain energies have been developed based on the use of energies of isodesmic and homodesmotic reactions and on the so-called 'strainless increments', i.e. heats of formation of certain groups (CH3, CH2, CH, Cetc)."

By employing theoretical models of increasing complexity for the reference (e.g., SCF, MP2, CCSD), the accuracy in the target states’ description can be systematically improved.

The ratio can be expressed as the equilibrium constant for the isotopic exchange reaction:  in which reactants such as B that are not isotopically substituted do not appear. The potential energy surfaces of isotopic molecules are identical to a high degree of approximation, so thermodynamic isotope effects can only arise from the effect of isotopic mass on the nuclear motions of the reactants and products, and can be expressed quantitatively in terms of partition function ratios for nuclear motion:  Although the nuclear partition function is a product of the translational, rotational and vibrational partition functions, the isotope effect is determined almost entirely by the last named, specifically by vibrational modes involving motion of isotopically different atoms. In the case of light atoms (i.e. protium vs. deuterium or tritium) at moderate temperatures, the isotope effect is dominated by zero-point energy differences."

This is the preferred term for experiments producing plots of temperature versus volume of titrant in which the main goal is a quantitative determination. Nonetheless, when a calorimetric vessel is used, such that the heat capacity is known, thermodynamic parameters may also be estimated from such experiments. An acceptable synonym in that case is enthalpimetric titration. The use of the adjective thermometric is justified because of widespread historical and current usage, and because a titration of necessity implies a chemical reaction. The term thermometric enthalpy titration has been used, but is not recommended. A method in which the titrant is a catalyst for an indicator reaction that occurs after the endpoint for the analyte reaction should be called a thermometrictitration with catalytic endpoint detection, not a catalytic thermometric titration."

If the endpoint coincides with the addition of the exact chemical equivalence, it is called the equivalence point or stoichiometric or theoretical endpoint, thus allowing the amount of A to be found from known amounts of B added up to this point, the reacting weight ratio of A to B being known from stoichiometry or otherwise. Terms for varieties of titration can reflect the nature of the reaction between A and B. Thus, there are acid–base, complexometric, chelatometric, oxidation–reduction, and precipitation titrations. Additionally, the term can reflect the nature of the titrant, such as acidimetric, alkalimetric, and iodometric titrations as well as coulometric titrations, in which the titrant is generated electrolytically rather than being added as a standard solution."

In a Newman projection the torsion angle is the angle (having an absolute value between 0° and 180°) between bonds to two specified (fiducial) groups, one from the atom nearer (proximal) to the observer and the other from the further (distal) atom. The torsion angle between groups A and D is then considered to be positive if the bond A-B is rotated in a clockwise direction through less than 180° in order that it may eclipse the bond C-D: a negative torsion angle requires rotation in the opposite sense. Stereochemical arrangements corresponding to torsion angles between 0° and ±90° are called syn (s), those corresponding to torsion angles between ±90° and 180° anti (a). Similarly, arrangements corresponding to torsion angles between 30° and 150° or between -30° and -150° are called clinal (c) and those between 0° and 30° or 150° and 180° are called periplanar (p). The two types of terms can be combined so as to define four ranges of torsion angle; 0° to 30° synperiplanar (sp); 30° to 90° and -30° to -90° synclinal (sc); 90° to 150°, and -90° to -150° anticlinal (ac); ±150° to 180° antiperiplanar (ap). [image: Not defined] The synperiplanar conformation is also known as the syn- or cis-conformation; antiperiplanar as anti or trans and synclinal as gauche or skew. For macromolecular usage the symbols T, C, G+, G-, A+ and A- are recommended (ap, sp, +sc, -sc, +ac and -ac respectively)."

The composition of aerosols in the troposphere has been used as a qualitative tracer of air masses.

      "In theories describing elementary reactions it is usually assumed that there is a transition state of more positive molar Gibbs energy between the reactants and the products through which an assembly of atoms (initially composing the molecular entities of the reactants) must pass on going from reactants to products in either direction. In the formalism of 'transition state theory' the transition state of an elementary reaction is that set of states (each characterized by its own geometry and energy) in which an assembly of atoms, when randomly placed there, would have an equal probability of forming the reactants or of forming the products of that elementary reaction. The transition state is characterized by one and only one imaginary frequency. The assembly of atoms at the transition state has been called an activated complex. (It is not a complex according to the definition in this Compendium.) It may be noted that the calculations of reaction rates by the transition state method and based on calculated potential-energy surfaces refer to the potential energy maximum at the saddle point, as this is the only point for which the requisite separability of transition state coordinates may be assumed. The ratio of the number of assemblies of atoms that pass through to the products to the number of those that reach the saddle point from the reactants can be less than unity, and this fraction is the 'transmission coefficient' κ. (There are also reactions, such as the gas-phase colligation of simple radicals, that do not require 'activation' and which therefore do not involve a transition state.)"

      "A theory of the rates of elementary reactions which assumes a special type of equilibrium, having an equilibrium constantK‡, to exist between reactants and activated complexes. According to this theory the rate constant is given by: k = (kB.T/h).K‡ is the Boltzmann constant and h is the Planck constant. The rate constant can also be expressed as: k = (kB.T/h).exp(Δ‡S°/R).exp(-Δ‡H°/R.T), the entropy of activation, is the standard molar change of entropy when the activated complex is formed from reactants and k = (kB.T/h).exp(Δ‡S°/R).exp(-Δ‡H°/R.T), known as the Gibbs energy of activation, is the standard molar Gibbs energy change for the conversion of reactants into activated complex. A plot of standard molar Gibbs energy against a reaction coordinate is known as a Gibbs-energy profile; such plots, unlike potential-energy profiles, are temperature-dependent. In principle the equations above must be multiplied by a transmission coefficient, κ, which is the probability that an activated complex forms a particular set of products rather than reverting to reactants or forming alternative products. It is to be emphasized that Δ‡S°, Δ‡H° and Δ‡G° occurring in the former three equations are not ordinary thermodynamic quantities, since one degree of freedom in the activated complex is ignored. Transition-state theory has also been known as absolute rate theory, and as activated-complex theory, but these terms are no longer recommended."

One of the characteristics of a reference material or reference standard is that it must have a negligible sampling error between test portions."

      "A measure of the susceptibility to the influence of substituent groups on the rate constant or equilibrium constant of a particular organic reaction involving a family of related substrates. Defined by Hammett for the effect of ring substituents in meta- and para-positions of aromatic side-chain reactions by the empirical 'ρσ-equation' of the general form: log10(kX/kH)=ρ.σX is a constant characteristic of the substituent X and of its position in the reactant molecule. More generally (and not only for aromatic series), ρ-values (modified with appropriate subscripts and superscripts) are used to designate the susceptibility of reaction series for families of various organic compounds to any substituent effects, as given by the modified set of σ-constants in an empirical ρσ-correlation. Reactions with a positive ρ-value are accelerated (or the equilibrium constants of analogous equilibria are increased) by substituents with positive σ-constants. Since the sign of σ was defined so that substituents with a positive σ increase the acidity of benzoic acid, such substituents are generally described as attracting electrons away from the aromatic ring. It follows that reactions with a positive ρ-value are considered to involve a transition state (or reaction product) so that the difference in energy between this state and the reactants is decreased by a reduction in electron density at the reactive site of the substrate."

Such materials are often used to convert ultraviolet to visible radiation for detection by conventional phototubes. In X-ray spectroscopy a converter that emits optical radiation is called a scintillator. In most cases wavelength conversion is from short to long wavelength, but in the case of conversion of long to short wavelength the process is sometimes called upconversion. Wavelengths of coherent sources can be converted using nonlinear optical techniques. A typical example is frequency doubling."

The majority of these lines originate form the dipole-allowed de-excitation of multiply ionized or excited states, and are called multiple-ionization satellites. A line where the initial state has two vacencies in the same shell, notably the K-shell, is called a hypersatellite. Other mechanisms leading to weak spectral features in X-ray emission are, e.g. resonance emission, the radiative Auger effect, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transitions and, in metals, plasmon excitation. Atoms with open electron shells, i.e. transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, show a splitting of certain X-ray lines due to the electron interaction involving this open shell. Structures originating in all these ways as well as structures in the valence band of molecules and solid chemical compounds have in the past been given satellite designations."

      "Compounds in which an anionic site Y− (originally on carbon, but now including other atoms) is attached directly to a heteroatom X+ (usually nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur) carrying a formal positive charge. They are thus 1,2-dipolar species of the type RmX+–Y−Rn. If X is a saturated atom of an element from the first row of the periodic system, the ylide is commonly represented by a charge-separated form; if X is a second, third, etc. row element uncharged canonical forms are available RmX=YRn. If X is an unsaturated atom, doubly bonded to another first row element Z, the negative charge on Y may be stabilized by π-conjugation, Z=X+–Y−RnZ−–X+=YRn. Such ylides belong to the class 1,3 dipolar compounds. However, 1,3-dipolar compounds with only sextet-containing canonical forms (e.g. vinylcarbenes ) are not ylides. E.g. Ph3P+–C−H2Ph3P+=CH2 (often called a Wittig reagent), (CH3)3N+–C−H2, RC≡N+N−–R, (CH3)2S=CHPh(CH3)2S+–C−HPh. Note that ylide is a complete word, not to be confused with the suffix -ylide, used for some radical anions. Subclasses of ylides: Ylides RmX+–C−R2 having the negative charge on carbon are classified by citing the name of the element X before the word ylide. E.g. nitrogen ylide, phosphorus ylide, oxygen ylide, sulfur ylide. A further specification may be achieved by citing the class name of RmX before the word ylide. Thus nitrogen ylides include amine ylides, R3N+–C−R2, azomethine ylides R2C=N+R–C−R2, nitrile ylides, RC≡N+–C−R2. Some authors, who wish to express the positive charge on X, prefer e.g. ammonium ylides over amine ylides; such usage varies according to the heteroatom X and to national custom. The ylides RmX+–Y−RmX=Y (Y = O, S, Se, Te, NR) are usually named by citing the name of RmX followed by the additive nomenclature term for Y (oxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride, imide, respectively). E.g. amine imides; use of the less systematic synonyms amine imines and aminimines is discouraged. Some classes of ylides are known by trivial names e.g. nitrones, Wittig reagents (synonymous with phosphonium ylides)."

However, if log 10 k 1 is linear in log 10 H + then water is involved. This has been shown to be incorrect by Hammett himself."

The ZDO approximation greatly simplifies the computation of wavefunctions by eliminating many of two-electron integrals. At the ZDO approximation all three- and four-centered integrals vanish."
