      <text>Third-party attestation related to a laboratory conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>Examples of conformity assessment tasks for which accreditation can be granted are measurement, testing, inspection, provision of proficiency testing schemes, and production of reference materials.</item>
        <item>The criteria for determining a laboratory's competence are based on relevant international standards, for example, ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 15189, or ISO 15195, and include adequate quality assurance and quality control procedures, such as qualifications, training and experience of staff, appropriate equipment that is properly calibrated and maintained, use of validated measurement procedures, participation in interlaboratory comparisons, and appropriate sampling practices.</item>
