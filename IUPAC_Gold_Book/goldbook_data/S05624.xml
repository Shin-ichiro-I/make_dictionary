      <text>Units, increments or samples taken one at a time or in successive predetermined groups, until the cumulative result of their measurements (typically applied to attributes), as assessed against predetermined limits, permits a decision to accept or reject the population or to continue sampling. The number of observations required is not determined in advance, but the decision to terminate the operation depends, at each stage, on the results of the previous observations. The plan may have a practical, automatic termination after a certain number of units have been examined.</text>
