      <text>A transition in which the cell dimensions and/or angles of the one phase differ from those in the other phase, but where the space-group symmetry is conserved. Example: The transition of face-centred cubic Ce, upon cooling, to a face-centred cubic phase that is 10% denser. Upon cooling, enough contraction takes place to allow an overlap of the fsp 2 configuration and the change from an isolated non-bonding magnetic f electron to a bonding non-magnetic electron pair.</text>
