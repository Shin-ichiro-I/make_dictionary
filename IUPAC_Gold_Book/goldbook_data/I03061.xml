      <text>A change which takes place in an instrument reading over a stated period of unattended operation for a given value of the air quality characteristic. It can be characterized by the variation with time of its mean, specifying the drift and by the dispersion. Span instability is the change which takes place in instrument span over a stated period of unattended operation. Zero instability is the change in instrument reading in response to a zero sample over a stated period of unattended operation.</text>
