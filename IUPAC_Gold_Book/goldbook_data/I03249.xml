      <text>An arrangement in which ions with a desired range of quotients mass/charge are first made to describe stable paths under the effect of a high-frequency electric quadrupole field, and are then separated and presented to a detector by adjusting the field so as to selectivity induce path instability according to their respective mass/charge ratios.</text>
