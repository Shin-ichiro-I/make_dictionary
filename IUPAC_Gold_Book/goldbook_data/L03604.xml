      <text>The substance fraction of the atomized component in the total volatilized component. This quantity is measured in a defined part of the flame, usually the observation space. The fraction atomized is the result of chemical reactions in the gaseous state. It depends on the bond strength of the compounds that the component may form within the flame and on the composition and temperature of the flame. When analysing elements that tend to become oxidized in the flame, it may be advisable to use as fuel gas mixtures with a reducing component such as C2H2 or N2O.</text>
