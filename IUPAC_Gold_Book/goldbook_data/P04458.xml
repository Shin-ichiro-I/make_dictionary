      <text>The volume of mobile phase entering the column between the start of the elution and the emergence of the peak maximum, or the corresponding time. In most of the cases, this is equal to the total retention volume (time). There are, however, cases when the elution process does not start immediately at sample introduction. For example, in liquid chromatography, sometimes the column is washed with a liquid after the application of the sample to displace certain components which are of no interest and during this treatment the sample does not move along the column. In gas chromatography, there are also cases when a liquid sample is applied to the top of the column but its elution starts only after a given period. This term is useful in such cases.</text>
