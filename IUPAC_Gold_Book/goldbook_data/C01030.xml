      <text>An analytical method of defined structure that has been brought into a state of statistical control, such that its imprecision and bias are fixed, given the measurement conditions. This is prerequisite for the evaluation of the performing characteristics of the method, or the development of meaningful uncertainty statements concerning analytical results.</text>
