      <text>The accessibility of the atoms of metal in metallic catalysts, supported or unsupported, depends upon the percentage of the total atoms of metal which are surface atoms. It is recommended that the term percentage exposed be employed for this quantity rather than the term dispersion which has been frequently employed.</text>
