      <text>A process wherein a charged species interacts with a neutral reactant to produce either chemically different species or changes in the internal energy of one or both of the reactants. The contrasting expression ion/neutral reaction is not ideal, simply because the word neutral is not a noun. However, any alternatives such as ion/neutral species reaction are so clumsy as to mitigate against their general acceptance</text>
