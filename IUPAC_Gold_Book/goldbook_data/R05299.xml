      <text>Multiple (or two) samples taken under comparable conditions. This selection may be accomplished by taking units adjacent in time or space. Although the replicate samples are expected to be identical, often the only thing replicated is the act of taking the physical sample. A duplicate sample is a replicate sample consisting of two portions. The umpire sample is usually used to settle a dispute; the replicate sample is usually used to estimate sample variability.</text>
