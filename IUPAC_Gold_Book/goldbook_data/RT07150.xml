      <notes>
        <item>Examples of reactive blending are: (a) blending accompanied by the formation of a polymer-polymer complex, (b) the formation of block or graft copolymers by a combination of radicals formed by the mechano-chemical scission of polymers during blending.</item>
        <item>Reactive blending may also be carried out as reactive extrusion or reaction injection molding (RIM).</item>
