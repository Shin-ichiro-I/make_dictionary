      <text>A light beam is said to be linearly polarized if the end-point of the electric vector moves in a straight line when viewed along the direction of propagation of the beam. If it moves along a circle the beam is circularly polarized and if it moves along an ellipse the beam is elliptically polarized.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>Circular polarization is said to be right-handed if the direction of rotation is clockwise when viewed against the direction of propagation and left-handed if the sense of the rotation is opposite. When the position of the endpoint of the electric vector is viewed at a given time t as a function of distance along x, it forms a left-handed helix if the light polarization is left-handed and a right-handed helix if it is right-handed.</item>
