      <notes>
        <item>When considering a product or a service, traceability can relate to: the origin of materials and parts, the processing history, or the distribution and location of the product or service after delivery.</item>
        <item>In, the term defined is "traceability". However, because of the potential confusion with metrological traceability, it is recommended to use the full term if there is ambiguity.</item>
