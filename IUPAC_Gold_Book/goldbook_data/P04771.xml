      <text>A version of reaction chromatography in which the separated components eluting from the column are derivatized prior to entering the detector. The derivatization process is generally carried out 'on-the-fly', i.e. during transfer of the sample components from the column to the detector. Derivatization may also be carried out before the sample enters the column or the planar medium; this is pre-column (preliminary) derivatization.</text>
