      <text>A transition in which the degree of order of the system changes. Three principal types of disordering transitions may be distinguished: (i) positional disordering in a solid, (ii) orientational disordering which may be static or dynamic and (iii) disordering associated with electronic and nuclear spin states. Examples:   The transition of LiFeO2, with a tetragonal unit cell, in which the Li+ and Fe3+ cations are perfectly ordered on crystallographically non-equivalent octahedral sites to cubic LiFeO2 in which the Li+ and Fe3+ cations are distributed randomly over all the octahedral sites.   The transition of orthorhombic KCN to cubic KCN in which the CN− ions become oriented in any of the eight directions.   A superconducting transition </text>
