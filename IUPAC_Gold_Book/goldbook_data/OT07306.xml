      <text>Co-continuous morphology in which a set of two gyroid-based phase domains exhibits a highly regular, three-dimensional lattice-like morphology with Ia3d space group symmetry.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>The domains are composed of tripoidal units as the fundamental building structures.</item>
        <item>The two domains are interlaced.</item>
