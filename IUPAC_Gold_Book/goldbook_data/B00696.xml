      <text>Materials which are not fully dissolved by acid-digestion at atmospheric pressure may require a more vigorous treatment in pressure vessels lined with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) glass, silica or vitreous (glassy) carbon or in sealed silica tubes; this treatment is called bomb-digestion. The test sample and acids are heated in such a closed vessel, so that the digestion is carried out at higher temperature and pressure.</text>
