      <text>Instrument by which the relative humidity of the atmosphere may be determined. It is generally composed of two temperature sensors, one of which measures the temperature of the air; the other sensor is moistened with water and senses the cooling due to evaporation of water. The temperature difference between the two sensors is a function of relative humidity; sometimes referred to as a 'wet-and-dry bulb' thermometer.</text>
