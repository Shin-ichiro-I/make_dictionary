      <text>A procedure in which parts or all of the separated sample components are subjected to additional separation steps. This can be done e.g. by conducting a particular fraction eluting from the column into another column (system) having different separation characteristics. When combined with additional steps, this may be described as multi-dimensional chromatography. In planar chromatography two-dimensional chromatography refers to the chromatographic process in which the components are caused to migrate first in one direction and subsequently in a direction at right angles to the first one; the two elutions are carried out with different eluents.</text>
