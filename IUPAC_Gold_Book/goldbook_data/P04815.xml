      <text>A burner in which fuel and oxidant are thoroughly mixed inside the burner housing before they leave the burner ports and enter the primary-combustion or inner zone of the flame. This type of burner usually produces an approximately laminar flame, and is commonly combined with a separate unit for nebulizing the sample.</text>
