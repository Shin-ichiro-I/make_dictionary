      <text>Property value derived from a collection of results.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>The term "consensus value" is typically used to describe estimates of a measure of location, such as mean value, median or mode, and dispersion derived from results reported by participants in a proficiency testing round (see participant in an interlaboratory comparison), but may also be used to refer to values derived from results of a specified subset of such results or, for example, from a number of laboratories chosen for their expertise for the particular analysis.</item>
        <item>The consensus property value, when it is a value of a unitary quantity, may be expressed as a mean, median, or mode, and is then termed "consensus mean", "consensus median", or "consensus mode", respectively. The mode and the median also apply for ordinal quantities and the mode applies for nominal properties.</item>
        <item>A consensus property value is an example of assigned value.</item>
        <item>A consensus property value could, through appropriate actions, become a certified property value; this is in analogy to the certification of a reference material.</item>
        <item>A consensus property value may be obtained in a material-certification study or by agreement between appropriate organizations or experts.</item>
