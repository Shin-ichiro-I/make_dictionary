      <text>A device to multiply current in an electron beam (or in a photon or particle beam by first conversion to electrons) by incidence of accelerated electrons upon the surface of an electrode which yields a number of secondary electrons greater than the number of incident electrons. These electrons are then accelerated to another electrode (or another part of the same electrode), which in turn emits further secondary electrons so that the process can be repeated. It is recommended that one should refer to the abundance of an ion, to the intensity of an ion beam, and to the height or area of a peak.</text>
