      <text>With respect to porous solids, the surface associated with pores communicating with the outside space. Since the accessibility of pores may depend on the size of the fluid molecules, the extent of the accessible internal surface may depend on the size of the molecules comprising the fluid, and may be different for the various components of a fluid mixture (molecular sieve effect).</text>
