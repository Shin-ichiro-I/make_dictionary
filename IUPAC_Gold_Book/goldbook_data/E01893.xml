      <text>A height used for the purposes of calculating the dispersion of emitted gases from a chimney, and which differs from the real chimney height by an amount which depends on such factors as the exit velocity, buoyancy effects and wind speed; it may also be affected by the local topography. It denotes the maximum height of the centre of a plume path above the level of the ground. The effective height may be above or below the actual chimney height, although the former case is most common.</text>
