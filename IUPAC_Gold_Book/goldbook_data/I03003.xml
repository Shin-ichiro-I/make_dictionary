      <text>An individual portion of material collected by a single operation of a sampling device. Increments may be reduced individually or tested either (a) individually or (b) combined with other increments with the resulting composite reduced in size and tested as a single unit. Increments are created by the sampling operation and are usually taken from parts of a lot separated in time or space. Increments of a bulk population correspond to units of a packaged population.</text>
