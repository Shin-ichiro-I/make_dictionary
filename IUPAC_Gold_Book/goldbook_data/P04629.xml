      <text>Recording of sequential single photons counted by way of recording and counting sequential electron pulses at the anode of the photomultiplier.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>Each electron pulse consists of 105â€“106 electrons resulting from the multiplication, in the 'dynode' arrangement (or the microchannel plate) of a photomultiplier, of a single photoelectron emitted by a photosensitive layer (the photocathode of the photomultiplier) upon arrival of a single photon.</item>
        <item>Technique used for two purposes: (i) sensitive measurement of low levels of radiation such as those originating from a luminophore and (ii) recording of emission decays.</item>
