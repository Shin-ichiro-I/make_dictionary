      <text>A qualitative term to describe a widespread body of air with approximately uniform characteristics which had been identified at a given time over a particular region of the earth's surface. Sometimes an air mass is marked by inert tracers such as SF6 which may be added to it. The composition of a given air mass undergoes alteration as it migrates, chemical changes occur, compounds are removed by dry and wet deposition and new impurities are added to the mass.</text>
