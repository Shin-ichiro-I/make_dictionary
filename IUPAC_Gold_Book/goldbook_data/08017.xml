      <text>Measured quantity value for a quantity of a component in a material, above which the component is declared to be present.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>The critical value is usually considered to be a characteristic of a particular measurement procedure performed in a particular laboratory.</item>
        <item>In some European legislations, the term "decision limit" (denoted as CCα) is used for the concept 'critical value'.</item>
        <item>The quantity measured is usually a mass fraction or a concentration but can also be, for example, a mass or an amount of substance.</item>
        <item>The critical value is chosen to give a probability α (usually 0.05) of a measured quantity value exceeding the critical value when the component is absent.</item>
        <item>The detection decision is made by comparing a measured quantity value with the critical value.</item>
        <item>Another important concept in characterizing the capability of detection of measurement procedures is the limit of detection.</item>
