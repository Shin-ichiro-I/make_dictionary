      <text>Material which contains no, or as little as possible, of the analyte of interest used in measurement to establish a blank indication.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>Testing, processing, and measurement of blank materials are nearly always an essential part of chemical analysis and may be part of quality assurance and quality control. See.</item>
        <item>The concept may be extended to more than one analyte.</item>
        <item>Terms such as "solvent blank", "reagent blank", or "matrix blank" are often used to specify the type of blank material.</item>
        <item>The term "procedure (or procedural) blank" is often used to denote a material that is carried through the entire measurement procedure. Terms such as "field blank", "calibration blank", and "instrument blank" refer to materials handled in specific parts of the measurement procedure.</item>
        <item>A blank material to which a relevant component has been added is often termed "spiked blank" or "fortified blank". Compare spike, internal standard, and measurement procedure with standard addition.</item>
        <item>If the term "blank" is used, for example, to denote blank indication or the related blank value or blank correction, this must be clarified by the context.</item>
