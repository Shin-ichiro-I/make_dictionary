      <text>The ratio of intensity of a separated ion beam to the intensity of the separated ion beam which has the greatest intensity. This ratio is generally equated to the normalized ratio of the heights of the respective peaks in the mass spectrum, with the height of the base peak being taken as 100.</text>
