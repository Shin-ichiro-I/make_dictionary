      <text>The process of removing solute(s) from a loaded solvent or extract. Generally this refers to the main solute(s) present.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>Where appropriate, e.g. when liquid-liquid distribution is used for stripping, the term back-extraction can be used. The terms back-washing and re-extraction are not recommended.</item>
        <item>The recent application of selective stripping of solutes as a separation method leads to some confusion between the terms stripping and scrubbing (in solvent extration, in atmospheric chemistry). It is recommended that the term scrubbing (in solvent extration, in atmospheric chemistry) be reserved for the operation of removing contaminants (impurities) from an extract (where the scrub raffinate (in solvent extration, in atmospheric chemistry) is often recycled to the loading step) and the term selective stripping be used where two or more main solutes are stripped successively from an extract, usually with different stripping agents, with a view to their subsequent separate recovery (in solvent extration, in atmospheric chemistry) from solution for analysis.</item>
