      <text>An ion/neutral species interaction in which an electron or electrons are stripped from the ion and/or the neutral species in the collision. Generally, this term has come to be used to describe collisions of fast-moving ions with a neutral species in which the neutral species is ionized with no change in the number of charges carried by the ion. Care should be taken when this term is used to emphasize if charge stripping of the ion has taken place.</text>
