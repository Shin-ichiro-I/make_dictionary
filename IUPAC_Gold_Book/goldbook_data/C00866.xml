      <text>A process by which materials are carried into a reaction mixture to which they do not belong. These materials can be either parts of a specimen, or reagents including the diluent or wash solution. In such cases, carry-over means the transfer of material (specimen or reagents) from one container, or from one reaction mixture, to another one. It can be either unidirectional or bidirectional in a series of specimens or assays. The term carry-over effect is used for carry-over from specimen to specimen.</text>
