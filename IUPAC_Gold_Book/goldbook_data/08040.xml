      <text>Condition of measurement, out of a set of conditions that includes the same measurement procedure, same operators, same measuring system, same operating conditions, and same location, and replicate measurements on the same or similar objects over a short period of time.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>A condition of measurement is a repeatability condition only with respect to a specified set of repeatability conditions.</item>
        <item>In ISO 3534-2, "same operator" (singular) is stipulated as a repeatability condition. The VIM request of "same operators" (plural) should be understood such that if two or more operators contribute to one measurement, they should be involved in the same way in repeated measurements.</item>
        <item>In analytical chemistry, the phrase "under repeatability conditions" refers to the above specified set of conditions.</item>
        <item>A set of measurements under repeatability conditions is often termed "analytical run".</item>
