      <text>The phase remaining after extraction of some specified solute(s). When necessary it should be further specified, e.g. scrub raffinate. The original meaning of raffinate as a 'refined product' has become extended and changed by common usage. The term should normally be applied only to waste streams but the latter may form the feed to a further extraction process for another solute.</text>
