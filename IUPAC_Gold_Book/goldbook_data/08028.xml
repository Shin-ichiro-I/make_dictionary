      <text>Detailed description of a measurement according to one or more measurement principles and to a given measurement method, based on a measurement model and including any calculation to obtain a measurement result.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>A measurement procedure is usually documented in sufficient detail to enable an operator to perform a measurement.</item>
        <item>A measurement procedure can include a statement concerning a target measurement uncertainty.</item>
        <item>Measurement procedures in chemistry can be structured according to ISO 78-2 or Annex A of the Eurachem Guide "The Fitness for Purpose of Analytical Methods".</item>
        <item>An authorized measurement procedure is sometimes termed "standard operating procedure" (SOP) or "recommended operating procedure" (ROP).</item>
        <item>In ISO/IEC 17025, the term "method" is used for measurement procedure. "Examination procedure" is defined for medical laboratories.</item>
        <item>The historical term "assay" is now largely obsolete as a synonym for metrological terms such as measurement procedure but still used in composite terms, for example, immunoassay and bioassay.</item>
