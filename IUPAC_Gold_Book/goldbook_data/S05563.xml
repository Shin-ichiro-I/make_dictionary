      <text>It sometimes refers to the discrimination shown by a given reactant A when it reacts with two alternative reactants B and C, or in two different ways (e.g. at two different sites) with a reactant B.</text>

      <text>The term also sometimes refers to the ratio of products obtained from given reactants. This meaning is of importance for catalysts, which can have a wide range of selectivities. Selectivity is quantitatively expressed by ratios of rate constants for the alternative reactions, or by the decadic logarithms of such ratios.</text>
