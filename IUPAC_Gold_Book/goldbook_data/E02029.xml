      <text>A device which is heated to the temperature required for analyte atomization by the passage of electrical current through its body. In open atomizers the sample vapour, together with analyte atoms, leaving the atomizer surface may move freely into the surrounding space. In confined atomizers the sample vapour is restricted by the atomizer wall except for the openings where the optical beam enters and leaves the atomizer and the sample introduction hole.</text>
