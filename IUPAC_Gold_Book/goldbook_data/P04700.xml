      <text>The gaseous and aerosol effluents which are emitted from a chimney and the volume of space which they occupy (often visible). The shape of the plume and the concentrations of pollutants in it at various points along the path of the plume are sensitive functions of the meteorology, local topography and the chemistry which occurs in the plume. Urban plumes are observed over many urban areas and downwind of these areas in which a combination of man sources of pollution are concentrated.</text>
