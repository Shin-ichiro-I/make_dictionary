      <text>The time during which nebulization must be carried out in order to perform one analysis with a given precision. The minimum consumption time is equal to the minimum volume consumed of the prepared sample divided by the rate of fluid consumption in order to obtain a given precision. It can be reduced by means of integrating the signal or measuring the signal increments (kinetic methods).</text>
