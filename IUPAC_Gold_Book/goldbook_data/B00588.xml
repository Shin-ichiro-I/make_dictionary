      <text>A large bag constructed of a suitable fabric which is often tubular in shape, into which a particle-containing air stream flows. Modern bags are constructed of a fabric which is capable of collecting all but very fine particles in the gas stream. The efficiency of the removal of particles of various size ranges changes with the amount of particles captured by the filter and the filtering time. The bag operates on the same principle as the one on a household vacuum cleaner.</text>
