      <text>A crystalline domain usually limited by well-defined boundaries.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>Polymer crystals frequently do not display the perfection that is usual for low-molar-mass substances.</item>
        <item>Twinned polymer crystals are, sometimes, erroneously referred to as 'crystals'.</item>
        <item>Polymer crystals that can be manipulated individually are often called (polymer) single crystals. A single crystal may contain different fold domains.</item>
