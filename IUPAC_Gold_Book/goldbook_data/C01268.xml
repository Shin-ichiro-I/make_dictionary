      <text>Two solutions that co-exist in equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure and, at constant pressure (temperature), change their compositions and relative proportions with a variation of temperature (pressure). The term usually refers to two immiscible liquids, but it is also applicable to two immiscible solid solutions.</text>
