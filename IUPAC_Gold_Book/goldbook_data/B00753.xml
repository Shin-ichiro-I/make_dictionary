      <text>In any technique that involves the establishment of a concentration gradient, either within the material from which an electrode is made or in the solution that is in contact with an electrode, the bulk concentration of a substance B is the total or analytical concentration of B at points so remote from the electrode-solution interface that the concentration gradient for B is indistinguishable from zero at the instant under consideration. In common practice the bulk concentration of B is taken to be the total or analytical concentration of B that would be present throughout the electrode or solution if there were no current flowing through the cell and if the electrode and solution did not interact in any way. In the absence of any homogeneous reaction or other process that produces or consumes B, the bulk concentration of B is the total or analytical concentration of B that is present before the excitation signal is applied.</text>
