      <text>A detector for the measurement of the spatial distribution of the radiation. Spatially resolving detectors can be divided into two groups:   the photosensitive area consists of a matrix of discrete photosensitive elements, the pixels (picture elements) forming an array with the facility to separately read out the information, simultaneously or sequentially.   the photosensitive area consists of a single photosensitive element that must be scanned (e.g. image dissection tube.)  </text>
