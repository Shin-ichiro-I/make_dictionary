      <text>Constancy of a property of a material over time.</text>
      <notes>
        <item>A material is said to be stable with respect to a specified property if its measured or examined property value does not fall outside a specified interval during storage under specified conditions over a specified period of time.</item>
        <item>A reference material is assessed for the stability of an embodied property under conditions of transport ("short-term stability") and storage ("long-term stability").</item>
        <item>The variation of the property value over time adds a contribution to the uncertainty budget or the examination uncertainty, as applicable. Regarding the assessment of stability of the reference material, detailed guidance is given in ISO Guide 35.</item>
        <item>The term "stability" is also used for stability of a measuring instrument or process (see control limit).</item>
